The thing is that I used to have one which expired (which I could download every time I needed it) but now they have changed the system and the new ones can only be downloaded once (and as a requirement you need to download it from the same browser, same device you got your credentials). </p><p>I registered, downloaded, and auto-installed the certificate in Android Firefox 68.8.1 on Pocophone F1 (MIUI Global 11.0.4) and there's no way to export the certificate in order to install it on PC, which is what I need. It is not even installed on the phone as I cannot use it with other browsers, and as I told you before, there's no way to get another one (just by getting an appointment at the Gov. office, which is very complicated at the moment). </p><p><strong>My question:</strong> Is there any possibility (rooting or not) to export the certificate in .pfx or .p12 format from Firefox Android? I do really need help with this. </p><p>I tried to install some addons that were deprecated, keychains apps are not working either, searched some forums and found out that this is a thing asked to the Firefox team for a long time (?). </p><p>Any tips and help are welcome! Thanks a lot and sorry for my English :). </p><p>Just to clarify, I cannot download the certificate as it automatically installs the file into Firefox, if I do this procedure in another browser, the certificate shows as invalid. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;mobile;,mobile,privacy-and-security,en-US,1317646;,josan.cj,false,false,1

However I Note there is something seriously missing here from a usability point in the Browser caused by lack of settings in the Home Section. </p><p>In Firefox, Options, Home Section you have only 2 choices  a Section Called ""Home Page and New Windows"" and ""New Tabs"" this is the area that needs to be fixed and here is why. </p><p>The Choices in the Home Section, New Windows and Tabs should have a 3rd New Option added called Simply ""Startup Pages"". The new Home Section would have 3 options as listed below. </p><p>""Home Page"" (an option to input a Single URL) ""New Windows and Tabs"" (again an option to input Single URL or an option for a Radio Button to ""Use Home Page Settings"" A new One Called ""Startup Pages"" ( An option for user to put in a Single URL or Mutliple URL's seperated by a PIPE simple for Multiple Pages. This new Option called Startup Pages should only load When you Start Firefox by clicking on the Desktop Firefox ICON of the ICON for the Firefox Program) </p><pre>Case In Point. When I startup Firefox I want to have it open Multiple Pages so I have what I need, this saves me time and avoids me opening what I want loaded EVERY TIME I use Firefox. You give us that option currently in a setting called ""Home Page and New Windows"" However you also use this when a user clicks on the Home ICON on the toolbar or open a New Window. </pre> <p>I and others do not want multiple pages to load each time I select the Home ICON as they are already open and most users want those STARTUP Pages to remain Open while they Browse. I also do not want my Multiple Pages to Open when I select a new WINDOW or new TAB. in the current setup you can quickly have the same pages open many many times based on the current interface options in the Home Section. </p><p>When a user wants to open Multiple Pages at Startup, they Most Generally do not want their multiple pages set in Firefox Options, Home, Home and New Windows to reopen when you want a simple NEW Window or Select the Home Page ICON. Most Users, myself included, want only a single web page to open when selecting the Home Icon in the Toolbar or When Selecting to Open a New Window, and generally users want it to be a Search Engine Page or Firefox Default Web Page. The new Microsoft Edge Browser also has issues with this type of operation and omits settings to accomplish my request.  </p><p>Unfortunately GOOGLE CHROME does have options to achieve the Settings Separately and they have settings for Show Home Button, which let's you set a URL or New Tab Page, if New Tab Page is selected it simply Opens Up the Google Search page, Startup Page(s). They also have an Option and settings for On Startup where you can set a single page or Multiple pages. In Google Chrome if you want to open a new Window it simply opens the Google Chrome Search Page.  </p><p>In closing I really like the new Firefox, You have done a Great Job and it is Light Years better than the New Edge Browser or Google Chrome, however to make it Really Rock and BEST IN CLASS for Operations I am hoping you can make changes to the Firefox Options, Home section to allow a more flexible and sensible operation of the Firefox Browser for Home, New Window or Tab and Startup, this would be Awesome and I do not think it would be a Major Change in the Code by adjust the Home Settings and adding a new Option </p><p>Thank you for Consideration of this Feature Request, please keep up the Great Work. </p>",customize;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;,firefox,customize,en-US,1317426;,brent.ruggles,false,false,1

For the most part each feed will show images the same as my brand X. There is one feed in particular that shows no images - just a brief summary of the the article and the link up above in the header whihc takes me to the website article. The web reader has a full pic for this thread not sure why this particular feed doesn't show images in TB. </p><p>The question has to do with nearly all my feeds that have pics showing in the right side reading pane where the article shows up. Under view I have =&gt; Display Attachments inline. Any emails I receive with images are blocked and I need to manually chose =&gt; Show Remote Content I understand this doesn't have anything to do with inline image and is for security. Therefore since images are appearing in the RSS feeds I assume they are not remote content but are embedded images otherwise they would be blocked? If I disable EDIT: =&gt; Display Attachments - the images in the RSS feed are no longer visible.  </p><p>I question if there is a security risk to be showing the inline images. Going back to the web reader there is an option to =&gt; Securely tunnel images thru brand X proxy - therefore the images that automatically show up are being downloaded from brand X back end server and my web browser retrieves them from brand X server not the RSS sender supposedly preventing any personal data from being sent back to RSS sender.  </p><p>If downloading inline images are a security / privacy risk why are they not blocked by default in TB like the remote content? </p><p>I am computer illiterate to a certain extent though I have every possible privacy add-on and about:config modification done to firefox and a few adjustment to the config editor in TB as well to limit exposure. Are the inline images a prviacy threat?

Pinholes make p.poor peepholes.  You have no idea the rage such stupidity can generate in such a mild guy as I (I actually am, but I have limited tolerance with stupidity).  That means others will be even less pleased and you'll  miss seeing the large astronomical body heading for your head. First, let me clue you in that e-mails sent via FF. aren't as wide on the right as e-mails sent via M.S.  It took years for me to realize that that was the reason why certain e-mails to the VA weren't working!   In all other matters I was happily using ver. 75 (?) for many, many years.  Then, through a less than clear process, I ended up with version 76!  Trying to ape the ""cool"" crowd is usually NOT a good idea!  Stick with building an easy to use and solidly better product that works.  Forego the flim-flam ""cool"" crap of your competitor and people will beat a highway to your door!  Which brings me back to v. 76..... After considerable effort it finally was beginning to show some promise, but trying to make adjustments, starting with the tiny, tiny print was becoming an exercise in frustration, fury and futility!  Who in your organization is stupid enough to think this is OK?  I suggest you collect their belongings immediately and escort them to the door!  I was trying to customize that work (v. 76) in progress, but ........ I give up!  There's no useful assistance info either, not even something a masochist would grudgingly use!  I'd be happy to be able to return/revert to v. 75. Just show me the way.  I can even learn to live with the level of 'ads' in e-mails that v. 75 has.   This was the original poison in the well, and they weren't winning.   So, it's up to you.  I detested µSoft from their beginnings in chicanery and still do, but if I have to deal with that cesspool, I'll just get a bigger nasal clip and do the best I can. </p>",other;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1317273;,bytedog1,false,false,1

It correctly states the server and user name. </p><p>This issue has recurred intermittently over the last couple of days, several days after the last Thunderbird update. It did not immediately start after the last update. Today it is recurring every time I try to send an email from a certain account. Receiving email is usually not affected. </p><p>I have no issues with my Yahoo account. The troubled account settings are as pictured below.  </p><p>I have already gone through tech support with Bluehost. They see no errors at their end and they sent me here. But it does seem that if Thunderbird were really causing the problem, by not sending the password correctly, that should happen with all my mail servers, not just one.  </p><p>I already tried deleting both the mailbox and SMTP passwords in the password manager, and then saving them afresh with a freshly set password. No difference. </p><p>Before this issue, I had not made any changes to my server settings in at least a year. Here are the outgoing server settings: </p><p>Description: &lt;empty&gt; Server name: <a href=""http://box850.bluehost.com"" rel=""nofollow"">box850.bluehost.com</a> Port: 465 Connection security: SSL/TLS Authentication method: Normal password </p><p>The username is irrelevant and has not been changed. It still matches my domain name at Bluehost.  </p><p>I tried changing the connection security setting to STARTTLS. That automatically changed the port to 587, but it made no difference to the issue.  </p><p>I added Thunderbird to my Windows firewall permissions. It's very strange that it wasn't there already! But that did not resolve the issue either -- and it shouldn't have, since I didn't remove Thunderbird from the list. I had never brought up that dialog before today. </p><p>A related page here suggested turning off various levels of Antivirus software. I use Avast Security. It doesn't seem to have any setting that would restrict outgoing emails. And if it were restricting something, the Thunderbird error message should be something more like ""Unable to reach server"", not a login failure message. And it should affect all email accounts that use the same settings. I have another username at the same server and I see that that account is suffering from the same issue.  </p><p>Another related page suggests deleting three files from my default profile, logins.json and a DB file or two. That would seem to get rid of all kinds of stuff that shouldn't be gotten rid of. I hear this kind of advice from bank CSRs, telling me to delete all my cookies. That makes me want to blow my cookies at the CSR! They have no idea how many websites I would have to re-enter my information for if I were to delete all my cookies.  </p><p>When I press Cancel in response to the ""Retry / Enter new password / Cancel"" message, another error message pops up: </p><p>""Sending of the message failed. Failed due to unexpected error 80004005. No description is available.  The message could not be sent using Outgoing server (SMTP) <a href=""http://box850.bluehost.com"" rel=""nofollow"">box850.bluehost.com</a> for an unknown reason.

Updating to new FF r76.01) crapped all over my settings and tossed my add-ons.,"<p>How do I go about restoring ALL of the settings I had in FF r76 or whatever was current ten days ago? Settings includes add-ons that were installed as well as whether or not they were enabled as well as the individual settings for each add-on. </p><p>In other words, I would truly like to avoid updating Firefox unless I have at least a couple of days to waste.  When I used to have things set so I would merely be informed when a new FF update is available whenever I start or restart FF, it seemed that FF was so unhappy with me not paying attention to it that it would cause problems with other applications or system utilities. </p><p>I have no reason why something caused FF to break other things just because I might have decided not to update it more than once a week.  I cannot see how any new release short of Ff r68 (or whatever the point of no return with Quantum was) or a bug fix of epic proportions that I should be eagerly awaiting should mess things up if I decide not to bother with it immediately. </p><p>The deleted add-ons and strange new settings/configuration situations caused by FF upgrades could be easily remedied without causing users much if any stress if they had an option to make a full backup of the current FF installation with all installed add-ons (active or not), settings, etc. to a user-specified directory and filename. </p><p>That way, users could always revert back a release or three if they found something horribly wrong with the latest update that they did not notice in the previous recent update(s). </p><p>What would make things much easier for me and many others I am sure would be upgrades that changed no user custom configurations back to some defaults that render the UI almost unrecognizable and initially useless without a lot of restoration work.   For example, why do the text menus I often use keep going away after updates occur?  Why do I have to avoid following links to what might be interesting Web sites because all the the security and privacy enhancement add-ons I trust and know how to use from long experience have gone missing? </p><p>For me, a Web browser is the home of my UI to the Web and most of the tools, accessories, and links I find most useful on the Web.  Essentially, the way I have FF set up by choice makes it my own personalized Web portal because even the Google Search page became too cluttered with announcements, disclaimers, and other distractions, when a simple Web query tool with an option for more advance queries was all I wanted. </p><p>Is there a way that I can quickly make this release of FF (r76.01) look, act, and function the same as the previous release did tend days ago?  I mean I should not notice anything different now that I cannot adjust or bypass so that I only have to worry about important changes, such as enforcement of HTTPS:-only which I was doing with an EFF add-on long before it was built into FF. </p><p>Using the above analogy, would most FF users who deal with landlords, property management, or HOAs be thrilled if every time they came home from work they found the landscaping had changed, new interior decorations applied in every room, and their favorite comfortable furniture not where they left it, but it moved to different locations that do not fit well with their usual household routines (or maybe just thrown out entirely)? </p><p>I have nothing against meaningful changes to improve functionality, performance, or appearance; but having those changes made in one's carefully configured environment for use in conjunction with the Web for no important reason and without the ability to undo the majority of what has changed in ten minutes (maybe an hour for alterations necessitated by the Web itself changes suddenly at times of, oh say, the worst pandemic since before the first nodes on what is now known as the Internet were linked and communications established between them? </p><p>I would be thrilled if my list of installed add-ons (enabled or not) never changed unless there were some that truly would not work because of some necessary part of an browser upgrade.  Ditto for the way I like text menus and dislike icons or entirely missing menus for about the same reason I dislike trying to make sense of Chinese road and building signage circa 1860. </p><p>I doubt I will bother to gripe about difficult to (mostly) repair Firefox upgrades a third time a few months from now, because the hassles they cause will probably be more irritating to me than caving in like most sheople and using some Chrome variant browser. </p><p>Really, I would like to know how to get as close to what I had in Firefox about ten days ago, excepting only absolutely necessary differences.  It would be miraculous if I could repair the look, feel, and functionality that was lost in the upgrade to FF r76.01, especially if I could do the work in less time than it takes most people reading this rant to figure out that I do not enjoy proofreading, especially when there are riots in the streets in many U.S. cities, live on TV ... just what we need during an economic crisis caused by an ongoing pandemic. </p><p>Regards, Mark (thinking of browsers, cars, home machinery, entertainment gear with standardized UIs, appliance-style) </p>",download-and-install_1;desktop;firefox-760;windows-81;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1317319;,tmarkgibson,true,the-edmeister,1

It is on my iMac running Catalina OS15. History: Last week, after I changed my AT&amp;T/Yahoo email password, I had difficulty getting Thunderbird to accept the new password. I tried different server settings as well as creating a new profile and new accounts. Finally, AT&amp;T support set up a security key, which allowed me to access my Thunderbird incoming email and to send outgoing email. </p><p>In setting up a new profile or account, I lost all of my saved folders. I was finally able to restore them from my Profile folder, but made mistakes during my attempts. I may have restored from the wrong Thunderbird folder, stored either in Documents or Library. Lots of extra system type files were imported as you can see in the first screen shot. I put them in the trash, but it won’t empty.  The second screen shot shows the side bar with 3 different In/Out/Trash folders. Only one has my saved folders.  Several hundred emails were downloaded from the server into the Inbox. However, the date range is only since the problem began, even in the Inbox above the saved folders. The third screen shot shows Tool/Account Settings which may show the extra local folder. </p><p>Lastly, I lost my other two identities that I had set up.

The HTML Template doesn't attach images to the e-mail when it's sent, so the images are hosted on an existing website. </p><p>When I send the HTML Template using Thunderbird, the file size is over 200kb - which is a problem given Gmail cuts off sections of e-mails which are over 102kb in size. </p><p>What's stranger is that when we input the same HTML Template and send as an e-mail via Gmail or even a basic webmail app like Roundcube (cPanel) - the e-mail size is more like 60kb to 80kb. </p><p>I've even tried sending the e-mail from Gmail to Thunderbird (which arrives at around 60kb), and then sending that same e-mail from Thunderbird, which then increases the size to around 160kb. </p><p>We've tried sending the e-mail individually from Thunderbird and using the mailmerge extension, and in both cases, the size of the e-mail is much larger than when the same code is sent from a different e-mail provider. </p><p>Is there something about Thunderbird which is causing this to happen!? </p><p>Many thanks for any help! </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1317114;,dmbyway,false,false,1

Most of the time, I launch T-Bird just to check my calendar. Because incoming e-mails are always a distraction in my workflow, I was wondering if there was any way of using Lightning *without* Thunderbird, i.e. a separate application basically. Indeed on one of my PCs I haven't set up an e-mail account in TB, but just my CalDAV calendars. This way, the e-mail setup wizard greets me  each time I want to look at my calendar. On my other PC, I have my e-mail account configured, and I can make it so that the Lightning tab is in the foreground when starting TB, but still the e-mail tab is open and e-mails are downloaded in the background. I don't mind having TB installed and using it for my e-mail is also fine I'd just like to <em>launch</em> them separately, so nothing e-mail related happens whenever I use Lightning. I sthere any way to accomplish that? </p>",calendar;,thunderbird,calendar,en-US,1316760;,ben.opp,false,false,1

Nothing I was able to think of doing would convince Thunderbird to accept them, until... out of desperation I created a second profile with just one of my several emails - the one that exhibited the rejection behavior - as a Hail-Mary, and it worked. So now, I open TB with the second profile (with the only account that brings in that particular list mail), filter the ""offending"" emails into their proper folders (I keep everything!), then shut down and reopen with the main profile. It's a bit tedious. My questions are: 1. Where does TB keep its profile definitions, and 2. What should I be looking for to prevent TB from rejecting emails with .eu or other hip and trendy, exotic tlds ? </p><p>Many thanks Julian O. </p>",privacy-and-security_1;,thunderbird,privacy-and-security-settings,en-US,"",julianop,false,false,0

However, I'm having a problem where the email folders are not staying synchronised correctly, even though all of the account sychronisation settings are turned on (as they were by default). </p><p>The problem occurred when I use another device such as my phone or web mail to move emails to another folder. For example, I receive an email which I see appear into my inbox on Thunderbird.  I then use my phone to move that email to a folder called ""Work related"".  I then go back to Thunderbird and I can see that the email has now correctly appeared in the ""Work related"" folder but it's also still showing in the inbox.  I.e. I have 2 copied of it, one in the inbox and another in the ""Work related"" folder according to Thunderbird!  I check this via webmail which confirms that the email has been moved corrrectly, so Thunderbird shouldn't be showing it in the inbox. </p><p>I've tried clicking ""Get Messages"" to get it to update but it does nothing.  I've tried clicking to other folders and back again, but it doesn't change or update. The only methods that I found which work are to either close Thunderbird and reopen it (it this case the email shows up initially in the inbox but quickly disappear as Thunderbird refreshes), or to right-click on the inbox, go to properties and ""repair"" the folder (a pain because it takes a while on the larger folders). </p><p>Same thing happens moving things between other folders if I do it on another device.  I have to keep restarting Thunderbird to get it to show correctly!  Using Outlook it was always handled correctly, but I want to move over to an open source solution. </p><p>Thanks in advance, Steve </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,"",steve_balfe,false,false,0

I don't have any emails in the ""email section"" of each contact I store all emails and phone numbers in the Notes section of each contact since its not unusual to have multiple emails and phone numbers for a contact I keep them in the Notes so i can make notes next to them. I have been doing this forever. </p><p>When I begin to type an email apparently it matches the text I am typing with all data in the contacts Notes section not the ""email section"" (which are blank.) What I end up with in the auto-fill drop down menu is massive chaos. I have 900 contacts give or take 15 since they fluctuate. </p><p>I went into Tools/Options/Composition/Addressing and unchecked all boxes it made no difference. I checked the box Directory Server / None thinking i can fool it into pulling from a non-server but that didn't do anything either. I have two address books each synced online with web based PIM. </p><p>I dread having to compose email. The only way I found to stop the auto-fill is uncheck the address book in the left panel in Cardbook but then i cant search inside of cardbook when I need something I would need to keep checking and unchecking the address book before and after sending mail. I opened two windows with cardbook opened twicw tried using one window for email with the adjacent cardbook tab address book unchecked and another windows just for cardbook and calendar functions address book boxes checked but when i checked or unchecked the address book in one window it changed the other window as well so that doesn't work. I would rather type addresses in manually or copy and paste directly from each contact if i can just figure a way to turn off auto-complete. Any suggestions?

It's not that it isn't working properly, it's that the mobile website you're viewing is a different address than the desktop site. For example, if I go to Kohl's on my desktop, the address is <a href=""https://www.kohls.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.kohls.com</a>. If I visit the site on mobile,it's <a href=""https://m.kohls.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://m.kohls.com</a>. Apparently the two sites are also entirely different, in that your desktop credentials won't work with the mobile site. Why that is I do not know, but this is not the first time I've discovered this problem with this, as well as other websites. The conclusion here is that this is not a Firefox problem, but rather a problem between some disparate websites which are not properly sharing login information between the desktop and mobile versions, and so if you run into this issue the only thing you can do is contact the owner of the website to let them know. It's also possible that this is simply a security feature and that you have to authorize mobile access, but of course the only way to find out is to ask.

I did not even okay this update. I have my preferences set to NOT automatically update. it seems like Firefox is ignoring my preferences. Firefox should provide an instant downgrade to the previous version that supported audio. In the past I have downgraded a few times until things were working smoothly, but it's a headache.

I made sure IMAP and POP is enabled in office 365 and also that it is enabled under my administration for this email address.  Godaddy told me Thunderbird does not support IMAP and I had to use different client. I tried two other email clients just to be safe and I get the same problem.

I bought a new Android phone a few days ago and it seems that when the new phone was activated, Thunderbird on my laptop quit working. The last mail received was May 17.   I use my Android phone to set up a hotspot to run my laptop, so they are actually connected somehow.  Various error messages, all seem related to the google server not recognizing my email or password.  Latest error is The STAT command did not succeed.  Error getting message number and sizes.  mail server <a href=""http://pop.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.gmail.com</a> responded: Username and password not accepted.   I've set Gmail to allow unsafe apps, that didn't work.  I've changed setting from Password to OAuth2, and it says it gave me a new password, but it still doesn't work.  I don't want to use IMAP, I only get mail on my laptop, and want all mail stored locally. I don't want to sync multiple devices.  I've removed my google account and re-added it to my phone, that did nothing.  I've made sure I'm signed out of all old accounts.  It appears to me that google suddenly decided to not allow access to their mail via 3rd party apps, because the built in email app on my phone gets similar messages relating to ""unsafe apps"".  It worked on the old phone, but not on the new phone.   I'm at a loss, and don't know what to try next.

Although ""just"" usability aspects, I think they cannot be overlooked in order to make Firefox the go-to choice of more users. </p><p>There are a four (relatilvely) small features that Firefox lacks in respect to Chrome and other major browsers, and a number of people miss them so much that end up using other browsers.  Namely: </p><p>1) There is no ""Type Address + Tab"" functionality when typing a URL of a website in the address bar and then pressing Tab so as to directly type the search that a user wants to look for once landing on the given website (this is a famous Chrome feature). </p><p>2) a CTRL + F search for a word in a web page does not highlight all words in a page, but only the current one is found (one needs to click enter to find the next one but it does not work like in Chrome or Safari which they highlight ALL instances of the searched text) </p><p>3) a laptop trackpad's pinch in/out with two fingers does not allow the zoom of a web page (third party plug ins fail at doing this task properly). </p><p>4) ALL other browsers open an incognito window with CTRL + SHIT + N. Why does Firefox does it differenly with CTRL + SHIT + P? This creates confusion for the average browser user. </p><p><br> I think having an attention to detail for such feature is <strong>really important</strong>. It would increase Firefox's userbase. Although a person choosing Firefox is making an important, usually conscious decision, about privacy, usuability plays an essential role for an average internet user. </p>",other;desktop;firefox-760;mac-os;,firefox,other,en-US,1314662;1314668;,federico.capaldo1,false,false,2

During the last couple of months i had cases where a Firefox tab crashed and restoring the tab always led to a bluescreen. I don't think that my Firefox instance is the main problem, but knowing the cause of those crashes could help me finding a solution. The last crash gave me the following crash reports: bp-5c21003e-9e92-4251-836d-1f8840200521 bp-9a8fa9a0-282e-4980-808b-9bb1e0200521 bp-a99a3cb4-aad0-48ea-b83b-ca3d00200521 bp-1c136cc7-029d-4ed4-9b33-c62a00200521 bp-de80bdf5-a533-49a5-8e07-d23e70200521 </p><p>If you are couriose about the bluescreen messages: In most of the cases the error message was Memory_Management and Kernel_Data_Inpage_Error. Because of that i tested my RAM and my Harddrive. Both hadn't any errors which led me to a dead end. Investigating the Kernel error led to failiure code: 0x0000007a which should be a file access error. That tells me that those blue screens should be tied together. Even if you give me some informations about the cause of the firefox crash report i would be very thankfull. </p><p>Sincerely Dave </p>",fix-problems;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;bsod;escalate;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1314623;1314630;,keine.spam3.14,false,false,2

I have tried a complete re-install, logging out and back in again, changing passwords and settings but it's not been working right for about two weeks. </p><p>First of all, all of my emails wouldn't load when clicking on them, they only displayed the subject in the overview browser. I had my settings as 'downloaded for offline viewing' so I tried making my settings so they weren't available for offline which worked for a bit but some messages took far too long to load, appox 3-5 mins per message.  I then re-enabled for offline use and my mailboxes took about 5 days between 9am-6pm to download, each time only managing between 200-400 messages out of 21000 (I am working as a business) before I got a notification saying the server couldn't complete the task due to being under heavy load. Once this eventually completed, everything was fine for a few days but it started acting up again so I reverted back to online use only which again, worked fine for a few days and now most or if not all of my outgoing emails hang and struggle to send, most with the error -  Sending of the message failed. The message could not be sent because the connection to Outgoing server (SMTP) <a href=""http://smtp.ionos.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.ionos.co.uk</a> was lost in the middle of the transaction. Try again. Or - connection timed out </p><p>I have also had issues with sending emails from my phone with attachments (pictures) where they just sit in the outbox not sending or doing anything, they don't have the red '!' like when there is an error which is puzzling and sometimes the emails show up days later. </p><p>I have tried speaking with my email provider (Ionos) and they were very unhelpful, I checked all my settings and details with them and they advised that nothing is wrong on their end. </p><p><br> Can someone shed some light on this and help me as I am at my absolute wits end with this!

However - my main e-mail address is the GMX address and couldn't be changed to gmail so easyly. But - as calendar I'll only use my gmail calendar. If I get a invitation on my GMX account, the calendar entry will be stored also in GMX and I am not able to change the calendar, that's used. If I crate a own event, I am able to select the account to be used and I can change the account &amp; calendar for an existing event entry later on. So - I'd like to define the gmail calendar to be used also for invitations that are coming via my GMX account - or to change the calendar later on exactly as it works for own created events. Is there a solution to do that? If not, is it planned or can it be foreseen for the future? Thanks in advance!

I did not consent to this, nor I was warned that was going to happen. It's important to note that while I'm currently residing in Russia and therefore have a Russian IP address, all my programs, my OS and Firefox were set to use English as the default and only language, and I had everything pointing to United States as my only choice of region/location/language in the Windows regional settings. Also, further digging reveled that these were not the only settings that were reset. Among them were ALL privacy settings, toolbar &amp; UI customizations, and Pocket has raised from the dead, despite being completely switched off with about:config settings. And I am yet to discover how many other about:config settings were reset as well. The history, downloads and bookmarks all seem to be unaffected and in place and order. </p><p>I know what the first reply is going to be: ""You've got a virus, bud"", but before anyone jumps to a conclusion that I've indeed got a virus/malware/whatever, absolutely the same thing has happened on my Linux install as well. No, it isn't a virus, at least on my end. It appears that Mozilla is the one engaging in such behavior. How else would you explain that both installs, one of which came from the official Mozilla's FTP, and the other one is from the official Arch repos, are both poisoned by this?! And guess what, I tried to replicate this in a virtual machine — absolutely the same result! All of the regional settings and the guest OS are set to English (United States), but I still get what I now call a ""regional inconvenience and overall experience downgrade pack"". </p><p>I'd really like to hear an explanation as to why this happens and possibly have a responsible person's attention to the matter, or at least be able to file a bug report (if it is a bug, which I doubt it is — take a look at the paragraph above). But regardless of that I believe that such behavior on Mozilla's end is intolerable, infuriating and disrespectful to both users' settings and the users themselves, which is not how I remember Mozilla, when I started using Firefox (that was around when 1.5 came out). </p><p>Now, a message to Mozilla: If this continues, and if this is how Mozilla envisioned the future of Firefox, I'm afraid it's time for us to part ways and either use a fork that doesn't do this, or join the evil forces of IE6 2.0... whoops, I meant Chromium/Blink. </p><p>You were indeed fighting for our freedoms back in the day, but apparently you are now fighting only for your monetary gains by pre-installing such regional inconvenience and overall experience downgrade packs. If I have an English (US) OS, but live in another country, I still want to have the same experience as English (US) users who are in the US. I don't need such ""convenience"". You need to understand something: nobody does! If they do have an urge to use a vanda...-""regionalized"" browser; they'd download an appropriate version and happily use it with their favorite search engine! Whereas me, and people like me can't, because you are forcing the same experience onto us. I've spent 15 years with Firefox and I wouldn't want to abandon using this amazing browser, but please, change your ways and consider your partnerships.

How do I make the menu bar stay in view, permanently?  The Menu bar hides when cursor isn't at the top of the screen. When the cursor is at the top of the screen, it triggers the menu bar to unhide; resulting in it partially covering where I want to click or type. This popping in and out behaviour is annoying, distracting and I'm constantly finely repositioning my cursor to get functionality.  Disabling full screen mode isn't effective because then the web page isn't large enough to be viewed functionally.  I need the menu bar to be permanently in view while in full screen.

Today I power on my computer and for some reason my Firefox account was not configured on the browser. I just logged in with my Firefox account and wait until it finishes syncing all. After a few minutes it finished ""correctly"".  I said ""Correctly"" because I was very surprised when I detect that all my saved passwords were not being sync. I tried with another computer that has the same Firefox account and it has all the passwords, but nothing appears on my computer. I tried several things like restart computer, logout and login again, checked if key.db file exists on my home, etc but nothing works. I just found one difference between the devices (both are Linux and bot are Fedora): On the device that I can see all the passwords Firefox version is 73. On the device that I described before that I cannot see any password Firefox version is 76. Can it be affecting the sync? I'm worried about to update Firefox on the devices that passwords are being displayed and lost it on both devices. </p><p>My OS is Fedora 31 and my firefox version is 76. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",fix-problems;sync;passwords;,firefox,sync-and-save,en-US,1314747;,ignacio.silvera,false,false,1

This set up has worked very well for my personal requirements now for about a year.  I can check both accts at one time and update my folders if necessary, all in one place. </p><p>But now Google has apparently decided it is not happy with my use of Thunderbird.  No reason given.  Nothing communicated explicitly.  So first, a few days ago, it blocked my Gmail.  ""Authentication failure while connecting to server <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a>.""  Then Google demanded I “recover” my account, which Google must have taken down, ‘cause I sure didn’t.  Said this would take up to 5 days. </p><p>I jumped thru all the Google hoops and did a recover.  I was told a “review” of my account could take 5 days. </p><p>I just received notification from Google my account is recovered.  Enter NEW password.   </p><p>Though I have NO IDEA why all this is happening, I did as asked.  New password. </p><p>Back in Thunderbird now, whenever T-bird downloads a Gmail email a Google popup obscures a large area in the center of my screen telling me to sign in to Gmail with a convenient “NEXT” to make moving me over to Gmail client nice and easy.  Now every time I click on a Gmail email, I get this popup. </p><p>Clearly, Google does NOT want me using T-bird, regardless of how well it works for ME.  If I got an explanation for this, it might help.  There might be what Google thinks is a justification all of a sudden to not want Gmail emails in T-bird.  But no reason/explanation has been given.  Just what feels like harassment. </p><p>So right now it seems to me I am being pressured to do it Google’s way or get harassed with this string of tedious demands and impaired service until I do. </p><p>I would love to know why this is happening and why Google seems so uptight about using T-bird client and if there is any way to get back to how I use T-bird and Gmail for the past year. </p>",other;tbgmail;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1314266;1314292;1314295;,jrizza,false,false,3

Everyday, Thunderbird annoys me with a pop-up telling me it could not update and that I should visit Thunderbird website to download a potentially new update. I do not want to do this every day. For a specific reason that I know, Thunderbird is prevented from checking for updates, but I do not want to change my general security config on my OS for just one app. So, my question is where is this little third button that states: “manually search for updates”. I understand it can be laughable given the wild wild web. Why someone would not want Thunderbird to search for automatically update after all? Because, sometimes, updates do break things, at least temporarily (e.g. remember Firefox and certificates) and I do not want to belong to the first batch of users to whom the update is going to be released. Also, there are users (maybe very slightly more advanced users, just a tiny more advanced, only slightly more like me) who do NOT want to be babysitted constantly and are able to take their own security without the constant reminders “please, do this, do that, your IP has changed, check your e-mail, please, enable 2-fa; etc. </p><p>Even more complicated: where's the hidden settings under MacOS platform to disable once and for all this update search function.

I go to a website while i'm there i get that same message safe mode or refresh. now it doesn't give me that message it just refreshes its self without asking me and does it around every 20 minutes so i stopped setting it back up. but tis still doing it. so i uninstalled firefox cleanerd all the leftover files and resistry keys rebooted then downloaded a new copy of the forefox installer. then installed i answered all the questions then set everything up and before i could go to a web site it refreshed its self How do I make it stop? Its refreshed 2 times while i tried to type this so i had to write it in note pad then copy it then paste it here. </p>,firefox-690;firefox-6903;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1313018;1313019;,Mr.Bobcat,false,false,2

I'm not exactly sure what is happening and no one will help me. The biggest clue was out of nowhere my phone boots up as T-Mobile when I actually have an unlocked Verizon device. I also have phone numbers and info in my contacts that I can't explain and my contact info has been changed including a link to someone else's Gravitar profile in my user info. I'm missing calls, texts and voicemails. My settings keep changing to allow location and other sensitive permissions. I looked at my call history and it shows that I been calling my own number for exactly 27 seconds several times over the past week. My Samsung account and Google account show I have two devices with the same model numbers. I found a sent email to my other email account that dated back three years before I had the email it was sent from. I found an APN in my mobile network settings that looks questionable, it's set up with a username and password.  Today I went into the Firefox browser using Duck Duck Go because there was a web address on the APN and my phone froze for no more than a minute and a website other than what I was looking for came up. I scrolled to the bottom to see who owned the site (WordPress associated with Gravitar) but there was a tiny little graphic on the bottom left corner that looked like a sound equilizer moving. It almost looked like it could have been coming from my internal system. So of course I clicked on it before thinking and was brought to a possible Chinese website I couldn't read a thing. Then I got off quicky after copying the address, made my Firefox security settings more rigid, closed everything out including my browsing history and closed the app completely. A few minutes later I got a notification that Firefox crashed and asked if I want to report it. I did. I guess I have a lot of questions. I don't know where to begin getting to the bottom of this. Google says it's Verizon's issue, Verizon says it's T-Mobiles problem and T-Mobile days contact Samsung. I think there may be more than one security issue I'm dealing with. I started using Signal as my text messaging default and I'm not known to frequent sketchy websites. I watch what I click on and check my Samsung, Google and Amazon security settings often.  If someone could point me in the right direction that would be great.

Reinstalling it is turning out to be my biggest mistake. Instead of the version 63 installing, which is what my installer was for the installer is only installing the most recent buggy version My version 63 had updates turned off, it should not have taken an update but it did even though the updates were turned off FOR security. I even had the registry set to block from HKLM When I am 'browsing' the internet I am logged into my machine with a user account that can't even make any changes. The current version (76.0.1) is having the same problems that plagued me before after this 'ninja update', the cache will not fully clear. When I open firefox it is showing it has items cached. There should be NOTHING in the cache when it opens, I do not have a home page set, there are no links set to open at startup and no connections should be made. The popup blocker is not only not blocking any popups it is opening them in new windows The machine does not have a virus or malware. Why is firefox so insecure now? The whole idea of using firefox was to be using a secure browser and just a browser it is not supposed to be integrated into the operating system it is not supposed to be interacting with the operating system it is supposed to be an internet browser. Without the ability to prevent this automatic communication and block unwanted traffic from it we may as well be using Internet Explorer, Edge or Chrome.  How do we install one of the older more secure versions of Firefox without it automatically updating at the time of the install? How do we actually block the automatic communication? How do we block popups as the popup blocker does not work at all?

They create a registry entry for it but there not used. I tried finding the file location but firefox has some odd profile naming that changes the folder name. That and the location from the articles doesn't have the file it says to open. As of now I am just lost. I'm not sure how to complete this task of adding bookmarks or the Home Page. I was able to get them setup as the default browser but without the bookmarks or favorite its all moot. We have over 300 users and they are about 3 weeks away from coming back to work.

This is a big hitch in my workflow, because I expect Ctrl-T L Enter to get me to Lfoo like it did before FF75.  </p><p>This is what I've already tried: </p> <ul><li> I tried config modifications to revert the bar to pre-75 behavior. When they didn't work, I reverted them. </li><li> I removed all other bookmarks with sites that start with L, notably LinkedIn. </li><li> I deleted all instances of LinkedIn (the site that was appearing instead of Lfoo) from my history. After this, instead of autofilling LinkedIn, which I barely use and hadn't visited in 90 days (places.frecency.fourthBucketCutoff), the location bar would not fill in anything after I typed ""l."" </li><li> I gave my Lfoo bookmark the keyword ""l."" This worked, but it's a total hack and I shouldn't have to do it; also, it doesn't autofill lfoo.bar.baz into the location bar, but just moves the cursor down to Lfoo in the dropdown when I type ""l."" </li><li> I ticked ""When using the address bar, suggest"" &gt; ""Browsing history."" This worked, but of course browsing history is now suggested for every other input (which I don't want-- it's why I had this turned off in the first place). I don't want Lfoo suggested on the basis of my history; I want it suggested because it's a bookmark and I asked Firefox to suggest bookmarks. </li></ul> <p>Because lfoo.bar.baz is a subdomain, not a .com, and a redirect to a login page, I suspect it has been discounted for suggestion in spite of it being one of my most-used sites and far and away my most used site that starts with L. </p>",bookmarks;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1312295;,rha.rao,false,false,1

I've been the victim of breaches.,"<p>I've had a hacker or whatever you would call someone who gets into my computer regularly. I have Malwarebytes Virus Protection and am going to get MWB Privacy. My debit card has been frozen x 15 days now without their sending me a new one. What this thug does is go to my email account, sign in as me, and tell them he/I forgot the password. Then he can verify it, and then he does the same thing. For about four months, he came and went, and all he did was change all my passwords. No matter what kind of secure p/w I used, he could always change it. On 04/26, I saw a charge on my debit card for $1.00 from FacebookPay or whatever, a verification charge. I immediately called FBPay and told them that was a fraudulent charge. I asked them to close the FBPay account. They did, but they also, without my permission, froze my card. I immediately reported that to the bank but they were busy merging with another bank, and they lie, so I still don't have access to my stimulus check or my last two paychecks. New bank is assuring me it's in the mail.  Naturally, I want to know what to do when I get my new debit card so the thug won't see it. I figure I can either order things I need from Amazon and eBay and then delete the card, or I could call them and give them the card info. I've been told I need to have this computer wiped clean, but that would leave me with no means of communication or getting my money out, since they only let you get $500 a day.. How do I deal with this thug? Thank you. I don't know much about computers. I'm considering taking it back to the store where I bought it and demanding one exactly like it or better but I don't know if that would go over or not. I can't pay rent, buy food, pay any bills, or do anything because the debit card people have all my money. I need to resolve the problem of my thug before I set up a new computer.

My PC has all my bookmarks, and I have it empty on android. On my first try after signing in on both devices and turning on sync, I did get a ""mobile bookmarks"" folder (with the few default bookmarks) on PC, but my many PC bookmarks did not appear on firefox for android. For now I've disconnected both, after also unchecking bookmarks from the sync in both etc. But I still want to get my bookmarks onto my phone from my PC, and I've read sync is how you do that. And this attempt did not sync any bookmarks onto android. </p><p>Edit: tried again the next day, signed in on PC first and then on android, with only bookmarks checked under sync options on both devices. This time it did work, and my PC bookmarks are all on android under ""Desktop bookmarks"". So that's cool. </p><p>Since my first try yesterday I had deleted my few default android bookmarks so that that one was empty. And I backed up and restored my PC bookmarks and tried a couple things. So this time around I don't currently have any ""mobile bookmarks"" folder on PC. I've added a couple bookmarks and subfolders on the mobile bookmarks on Android, hasn't popped up on PC yet. </p><p>Also a minor note, for some reason the ""bookmarks menu"" part was minimized after I first tried syncing, so for a bit I thought my bookmarks just weren't showing in the ""all bookmarks"" menu. So that wasn't an issue. </p><p>Anyways, still figuring out a couple things on the android side, folders etc. How they work differently than on PC. On PC you can have folders mixed in with bookmarks, but on android all subfolders appear at the top of a folder, instead of interspersed the way I placed them on PC. So that can mess with organization for me. And stuff like that. But mostly it's sorted out. </p>",bookmarks;firefox-7601;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1311743;1312093;,groovyxo21,false,false,2

Do note that my second question has NOT received A SINGLE REPLY from anybody. I have now updated to version 72 and then subsequently to version 76.0.1 (which the latest one at the time of writing this question.

But it still exists even in version 76.0.1, which is surprising. I have tried every possible combination I can think of, from setting <em>media.media-capabilities.enabled</em> = <strong>false</strong> in <strong>about:config</strong> to disabling specific codecs and hardware acceleration, none of which solved the issue permanently to my satisfaction. A few settings, at times, improved the issue slightly but there was no permanent solution, even though this has been alluded to in a previous release note. Do note that my graphics drivers are updated and this issue is Firefox-specific, i.e other browsers work just fine. Even the older versions of Firefox work fine, as stated earlier. I would like to state that I prefer using the VP9 codec because other codecs take a toll on my relatively low-bandwidth network connection and this leads to longer buffering times (VP9 does not have this problem). I humbly request the community members and volunteers to help me in this regard, <strong>and if need be, point me to the proper channel for lodging a bug report directly to Mozilla</strong>.  </p><p>Thanks and regards,<br> Preetodeep Dev. </p><p><em>P.S:-</em> If this issue is not resolved, then I will have<strong> no choice but to go back to Firefox version 62.0.2</strong>, which works just fine with all the default settings. </p>",fix-problems;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",preetodeepdev,false,false,0

Generally all works as desired.  However, intermittently (couple times a day ---&gt; once every few days) the browser simply, quietly refuses to allow the CAC to login, when I visit a CAC-secured site.  A browser dialog is presented and asks for my PIN, but closes without error, yet the PIN is not accepted and the site (correctly) refuses access.  In my troubleshooting, I found that if I look at the Security Devices tab under Privacy&amp;Security, the PKCS#11 module shows the CAC as not logged in.  If I attempt to log in at that page, I get the usual PIN dialog, but after submission, a new message box appears with the notice that ""Log in failed"", and I can see that module still says Log out.   </p><p>It appears that some file lock or related mechanism is in effect and needs to be reset.  The only solution I have been able to use is close Firefox completely (all windows), and restart.  This works but not desired as I have several different sites I'm active on, and each requires separate logins. </p><p>Any suggestions for further troubleshooting would be appreciated.  My forays into Google searches all end up as help to get CAC card working, which is not my problem.  The card works until Firefox (or something related in the middleware) freezes and the only recourse is to restart. </p><p>Cheers, --Jim </p>",privacy-and-security_1;firefox-750;desktop;linux;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",jimparker96313,false,false,0

It used to get cleared if the user clicked off the folder they were searching to another one, which was a simple way to clear it when finished.  Now the search is persistent and has to be cleared with the tiny X on the right of the bar.  Personally I find that this is such a nuisance that I'm finding myself trying to avoid using the Quick Filter Bar because it's too fiddly to clear. Please can you re-instate the old system that cleared the Quick Filter Bar when the folder focus is changed, or provide this an option, or some other really quick keystroke to clear the Quick Filter Bar which is less fiddly than hitting that tiny X. </p><p>Thanks and regards, </p><pre> Colin McCormick </pre> <p>[email] </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1311327;1311355;,colin991,true,sfhowes,2

I was poking around a website that I spotted opening additional browser windows behind my current one. These windows were advertising and the browser windows had most of the toolbars removed. My usual reaction to this is to immediately update my Hosts file with all of the URL's involved in the chain of events that opened up this unwanted window. However, after I did this, they still managed to open up despite being listed in my Hosts file to block! Here's what I noticed: </p><p>Blocked URL's listed in my Hosts file remain blocked when attempting to open in my main browser window. But these sneaky windows opened up behind this window had the blue / purple badge displayed. I learned that these ""pop down"" windows were resembling an incognito session as it did not contain my Firefox account info, or much of anything else. I believe that the use of the Privacy Protection feature is what allowed these advertising windows to open up despite being listed on my Hosts file -because the session is so well protected, that even Windows can't see what's going on in there! </p><p>I have to admit, I am actually impressed with the creativity of this trick. But to me this looks like in all simple terms to be an instance of taking a new feature and turning it around and using it against us to ploy their wares. It is advertising now, but I can see this easily progressing into malware if it hasn't already.

I want to know how to make the change I made in pavucontrol <em>persist</em>. </p><p>This can be mitigated by using the in browser volume controls (the youtube volume slider), but these are usually quite small and don't offer as much control as the pavucontrol sliders do. Something else to note is that if I go into Firefox's about:config and set media.volume_scale to a value greater than 1, the pavucontrol sliders begin to act how I would like them to (not resetting to 100%). However, upon doing this audio streams now start at 0% volume, and the in-browser ""mute"" button is broken (sets the volume to 0, but won't change it back). </p><p>Is there any way to achieve this behavior in Firefox?

Using Win10/FF76, with NoScript 11.0.25 (&amp; previous).   NoScript is only extension.    </p><p>Since AmEx redesigned their website several (many?) months ago, I've had increasing issues using Firefox to log-on the site via their (bookmarked) new log-in page (a bookmarked link to their old log-on page still works, as do all my other banking/financial sites, as well as 98% of other sites).   Log-on button reacts when clicked, but no action - doesn't seem to run its script.   Initially, allowing permissions multiple cycles using NoScript (as is typical for some sites, as scripts load) was sufficient (I try to reduce scripts to minimum necessary, always excluding Facebook scripts).   Logging on via link from AmEx home page sometimes worked slightly better.   However, internal site functions seemed to need multiple refreshes on load.   Within the last two months, only completely disabling NoScript for AmEx tab worked.  Today, not even disabling or uninstalling NoScript completely worked.   In addition, today cannot log-out of AmEx site without multiple (~10x) clicks on the log-out button (webpage seems to gradually close down functionality with each click and twirl of the script indicator, similar to functionality loading issue previously noted). </p><p>Clearing all cache and cookies (per FF forum help) works one time - log-on can be accomplished with two attempts, but log-out continues problematic.  Subsequent log-ons problematic. </p><p>As before, problem repeated on other computers (today, two other computers using Win10/FF76; one with a new Win10 and FF install w/o NS). </p><p>Previously, other browsers unaffected (Old MS Edge, Opera).   Today, using MS Chrome Edge, AmEx site worked without problem.  However, noted that AmEx log-on page loaded with Edge was old-style (that still works with FF, also), not new.   All SSL certs (FF and Edge) verified. </p><p>AmEx doesn't have any link to their Web Support - I guess I have to write them a letter..  Suspect it's a problem on their end, not FF, but have run into several sites lately where FF either doesn't run well, or is specifically not supported.   Don't want to give up privacy features and independence of FF, but would like some ammo to hit AmEx with, if it's indeed an engineered problem with their site. </p>",websites;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;amex;webcompat;americanexpress;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",co_gringo,false,false,0

It would seem like the competitive thing to do, so i must believe that there either is a real security reason, or simply the old extension was not as popular as i think it was. </p><p>I'm afraid i must admit that it has been so long that there are probably many alternative replacements to the Tab Mix Plus features that i don't recall, yet i really did prefer a setting to open links in a new tab rather than having to hold down Ctrl at the same time of clicking - i know it seems picayune, but it still is a preference! </p><p>I only mess around with VBA, so please use the ""big print and pictures"" method of explanation :) </p><p>Thank-you for your thought! </p>",firefox-750;customize;desktop;windows-10;tabmixplus;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",brucemc777,false,false,0

I'm running Firefox (version 75.0, auto-updates enabled) on a Windows 10  (Version 10.0.18362 Build 18362) desktop PC. I'm using the built-in Firefox password manager, although as a general practice I do not log into it using my master password unless absolutely needed (for example, to check my email or Slack). For the vast majority of the general browsing I do, I stay logged out of my accounts. </p><p>This has worked just fine for years. However, lately Firefox keeps prompting me to enter my master password, and won't stop prompting me for my password while I'm browsing. Oftentimes I'll randomly receive the prompt, often on sites that should not be asking for a password, such as a blank New Tab or sites that don't have any associated data in my password manager. </p><p>What's frustrating is that, when I close the prompt, Firefox will immediately re-prompt me again to enter my master password, despite me not wanting to log in (or on some sites, not having an account or even a login page). It will keep repeating this prompt incessantly, sometimes for 5-6 times before going away briefly, only to reoccur when I navigate to a new site.  </p><p>My browser is configured to be a bit more privacy-conscious, and I'm wondering if this may be causing this behavior. In Options &gt; Privacy and Security, I've set Custom blocking for the following items: - Cookies (all third-party sites) - Tracking content (in all windows) - Cryptominers - Fingerprinters I have also set my browser to delete cookies and site data upon closure.  </p><p>I am using the following plugins, with auto-updates enabled: uBlock Origin HTTPS Everywhere Privacy Badger Decentraleyes Cookie Autodelete Firefox Mult-Account Containers Facebook Container </p><p>I've searched the support forums for help on this topic and found the two articles below. However, after trying the offered solutions, neither fixed the underlying behavior. Also note that I am not using any third-party antivirus solutions, like ESET Internet Security and Avast, which have been known to cause similar issues with the Firefox password manager. Here are the articles I found: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-keeps-asking-me-master-password"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-keeps-asking-me-master-password</a> (I tried these steps and still had the same behavior happen) <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1176785"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1176785</a> (this just disables the Password Manager, something I ideally would not have to do to stop this behavior) </p><p>Can anyone provide any insight into why Firefox keeps doing this? I love Firefox but lately it's become a drag to use because of this.

1285923,2020-05-02 16:44:44 -0800,2020-05-04T11:36:48Z,Why can't I open Thunderbird under Windows after I have opened it under Fedora Linux - but TB under Linux Mint is okay,"<p>Problem: I normally run Thunderbird under Windows. After running Thunderbird under Fedora Linux 32 to check my emails, I get locked out of my Thunderbird profile when I try to run Thunderbird under Windows, thereby denying me access to my emails. Both operating systems access the same Thunderbird profile which is located in the Windows partition. This is a MAJOR PROBLEM to me. </p><p>Description I have set up my computer to be able to boot to either Windows 7, Linux Mint 18.3 or Fedora Linux 32. I run Windows about 90% of the time. I use Thunderbird as my email client. My profile contains 7 accounts from three email service providers. 5 of those accounts are POP3, and two are IMAP (Gmail accounts). When I am running Linux I sometimes want to access my Thunderbird email (without having to re-boot my computer into Windows) so I altered the Thunderbird profile.ini file on the Linux Mint partition, so that it points to the Thunderbird Profile on my Windows partition instead. I do this by altering the profiles.ini file (in the Linux Home/.Thunderbird directory) so that it reads (in part). [Profile0] Name=default </p> <ol><li> IsRelative=1 </li></ol> <p>IsRelative=0 </p> <ol><li> </li><li> Path=baxn61zj.default </li></ol> <p>Path=/media/WinC/Users/mike/AppData/Roaming/Thunderbird/Profiles/mzf9na1s.default Default=1 </p> <ol><li> </li></ol> <p>This method works very well with Linux Mint (which uses Thunderbird ver 60.6.1). I can check my emails and send emails, no matter which OS I am running, and they are all stored under my Thunderbird Profile on the Windows partition. And when I boot to Windows and run Thunderbird, all my emails are correct and in the right place. I can swap from Windows to Linux Mint often and get easy access to my Thunderbird profile with either Operating System. It is a great system and demonstrates the robustness of Thunderbird profiles. BUT the same does not work with Thunderbird under Fedora 32. When I run Thunderbird (ver 68.7) under Fedora Linux 32 it fetches emails and sends emails correctly, but later when I reboot to Windows and try to run Thunderbird, Thunderbird refuses to run and it gives me the following error window. ""A newer version of Thunderbird may have made changes to your profile which are no longer compatible with this older version ... Creating a new profile requires ..."" </p><p>Thunderbird will NOT open my profile or and will NOT give me access to my emails, even though both OSs are running the same version of Thunderbird i.e., 68.7. I am running Thunderbird 68.7 on both the Windows partition and the Fedora 32 partition. However the Linux Mint partition runs Thunderbird 60.6.1. This is a MAJOR PROBLEM because it means that if I open my emails with Thunderbird under Fedora Linux 32, I am thereafter locked out of my emails when I run Windows/Thunderbird. Windows/Thunderbird 68.7 does not foul up Linux Fedora 32/Thunderbird 68.7 under Linux Fedora, but the reverse, running Thunderbird 68.7 under Linux Fedora, fouls up Windows/Thunderbird 68.7 badly. I have been able to identify which files in my profile are changed by Thunderbird 68.7 under Fedora. And the change happens simply by starting Thunderbird and shutting it down - no other actions. I can provide more information about this issue if needed. In addition, I found that after Fedora/Thunderbird has fouled up my profile, if I then boot to Linux Mint 18.3 and run Thunderbird 60.6.1, it does some ""magic"" and undoes the ""fouls up"" or whatever Fedora/Thunderbird did, and enables Windows/Thunderbird to read the profile and give me access to my email again. Very frustrating and unnerving. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1310112;1310203;,jrmwalsh,false,false,2

When I click in some boxes, the size of the space bar changes. This results in me putting a period instead of a space. This is especially problematic if I am trying to put search terms into the address bar in firefox. I try to put a space, but a period is inserted instead and this results in firefox seeing it as a url instead of search terms. It is a great deal of trouble to then try and correct it and it is very frustrating. Can you allow me to disable the behaviour of the keyboard where it changes the key layout? Keyboard layout should not change, it works against human habitual behaviour. I cant type reliably if the key layout keeps changing.  This does not happen with some other keyboards such as hackers keyboard. I spoke to samsung and they claimed to have no control over it, saying that firefox is the responsible party in this case.

HTTPS, when added, preformed properly for about 15-20 minutes and then the CPU percentage spiked to 90% plus and would not drop.  Restarting FF said it was still running.  FF continues to run even though it has been shut down.  The process has to be killed before FF will restart.  The rogue process will run indefinitely if it is not killed.  Seems only to happen if HTTPS Everywhere is activated.  I have tested add-ons one at a time with no others active.  This is the only one that causes this behavior.  I really like that add-on but find its use prohibitive due to this problem.  There is no place on the add-on website to report this.  Should it be reported as a bug and, if so, where?

1285834,2020-05-01 12:38:36 -0800,2020-05-01T12:39:41Z,"ARTICLE: Thunderbird Portable (Mozilla Thunderbird, Portable Edition) and other portable apps as alternatives","<p>Portable apps are good. </p><p><em>Portable apps won't suit everybody's needs or everybody's particular use-cases, and some will even rightly point out that in a *certain* sense they are a step back to a much older way computer programs were handled, but they are a great addition to the options of the world now :-) .</em> </p><p>(<em>It might be good -- especially as time goes on -- to let some people know that in the computer context, ""app"" is short for ""application"", and that both are synonyms for ""program"" and ""software"".  I may use any of them.  And, oh yeah, ""folders"" and ""directories"" are synonyms when we're talking about computer file systems, too.  Just covering bases, since this is an article that I hope will be useful for some time.</em>) </p><p>I've found myself suggesting the portable edition of Thunderbird more than once now, usually tangentially but as something that might prove useful.  So now, to make those replies and my workload shorter by replacing all those words with the URL for this article, well, I'm writing this article once and posting it in the Thunderbird support forums.  But really, (almost) everything I have to say here applies to portable apps in general, so I expect it can be usefully referenced in many places beyond just Thunderbird's forums. --- </p><p><br> You can get Thunderbird Portable and LOTS of other portable apps from &lt;<a href=""https://portableapps.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://portableapps.com</a>&gt;, and do always be sure to update from whichever version they have there to the newest version immediately after installation.  Thunderbird Portable (or ""Mozilla Thunderbird, Portable Edition"") *<em><strong>IS</strong></em>* Thunderbird, just packaged in a way that gives many new advantages.  The same goes for all their apps.  While they may not have the latest version of a program repackaged as a portable app yet, updating a portable app after you get it is never done any differently than the ways they normally get updated.  NOTE: You do NOT have to get or use the <a href=""http://PortableApps.com"" rel=""nofollow"">PortableApps.com</a> Platform (suite) in order to run their individual portable apps.  And they have LOTS more than just Thunderbird and Firefox, LOTS!  And their offerings are all free, because they only repackage free, open-source software! </p><p>There are other sources and makers of portable apps than just &lt;<a href=""https://portableapps.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://portableapps.com</a>&gt; , to be sure.  They may do a few things differently, but the definition of a portable app is basically the same.  Just search for ""What is a Portable App?"" using <a href=""http://DuckDuckgo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">DuckDuckgo.com</a> or your favorite search engine, and you'll get multiple good results.  Read more than one for a better overall understanding, but the basics are simple.  Much of what I have here will actually repeat some of what you'll find there, but not all.  And maybe I'll phrase something better or have an example or use-case that strikes you better; we'll see. </p><p>What's good about portable apps?  They do everything and are used in precisely the same way as non-portable apps, from the user's perspective.  Their ""installation"" is really nothing but unzipping a single directory and all its contents (including any subdirectories); everything needed to run it is in that directory.  You copy/move/delete (deleting is uninstalling) the whole program just by copying/moving/deleting the single program directory.  This makes it very easy to back up an entire program (including everything you've done to customize it, and any data you don't store outside of its folders).  OS drive crash?  No reinstallation or configuration worries if you have it backed up; just copy the single program directory from backup.  And no worries about a registry or conflicting DLLs or anything like that, when you install or delete; it's self-contained, so installations and deletions are clean.  You can move or copy the program to a different location -- even on a flash drive or another computer -- without having to do anything differently; it doesn't care what drive letter it's on at different times and handles that automatically.  On a portable drive like a flash drive or SD card, you can take your whole program with all its data, configuration, settings, etc. with you to different computers. </p><p>(<em>I actually started using FirefoxPortable and ThunderbirdPortable years ago, when I had a job with a lot of free time at different places each night, each with a computer I could use, and I didn't own or want to buy a laptop or tablet.  I carried both on a flash drive, back and forth between my home PC and work.   I'd even copy them down to my PC's hard drive for faster speeds when I was at home, then copy back up to the flash drive when I was done or going to leave home.  [I haven't seen a web-based e-mail interface I like anywhere near as much as ""TB"", and have only seen one that was somewhat reasonable for my tastes.]  Without having to buy a laptop, and without installing any software on a work computer or harming anything there, I had the same browser and e-mail client at home and at every computer at work -- not just the same ""model"" of programs, the *very same programs*, just as if I was on the same computer.  I didn't bother to get a laptop until years later when a new boss decided we shouldn't use the computers for anything but company business at all; it was a temporary crackdown but long enough to force me to spend more money than a flash drive cost :-) .</em>) </p><p>Really, I just treat my *portable* programs like data now, and its great!  (<em>Oh, how I wish my tax software would be available as a portable app!  As it is now, I don't update after I send in my taxes, so that if my tax authority ever comes around to ask questions, I can show them the software and say, ""This is how the program calculated it right then, what the program said!"" without worries that it will do something differently than when I sent in my taxes.  But if anything happens that makes me have to reinstall the software from original discs or files again, it will either have to be not-updated-at-all or updated-with-all-the-latest-changes -- and that won't be proof of how the program was doing things when I sent in my taxes.  If it were portable, I could back up the whole program and not just the data files!</em>) </p><p>You can also even have multiple installations of a single program on the same computer, without any special steps or obstacles!  (Although, they may or may not be able to run at the same time, depending on the computer.) <em>For instance, on my laptop, instead of using different user profiles within the Firefox web browser for when my roommate has to borrow my laptop -- rarely, but occasionally -- I have my Firefox Portable on my data drive, and a whole other copy of Firefox Portable on my desktop just for them, and I occasionally create a new copy for special projects I want to work on separately from everything else.  I've just never dealt with user profiles before, never had to.  This is clean and easy for me, and *everything* about each copy of the program is independent and independently configurable.  What my roommate does to *their* copy doesn't affect mine, not my history, work in progress, cosmetics, add-ons, nothing.  and vice-versa.</em>  ...  This kind of usage does use some more storage space on my drives (be they hard drives or flash drives or SD cards or whatever), but I have that kind of space available now. </p><p>And in fact, that's what backup copies of my portable apps really are:  fully functioning standalone programs.  They'll run just the same way.  For both Thunderbird and Firefox, I make a copy every time before I allow an update to happen.  I shut down the program completely first.  I delete the current backup completely, never knowing whether just copying over it will leave behind any extra things that might cause problems.  And then I make a fresh copy of my ""in-use"" folder, using the same name with ""-- BACKUP COPY"" appended.  Clever huh?  Only after that is done will I update my in-use copy of the program.  Then if any functionality -- built-in or add-on -- has broken or changed in a way I don't like with the update, I just delete the ""in-use"" copy and replace it with a copy of the backup.  That's why I started keeping the backups, in fact.  [Note: I would still have to deal with anything I'd done in a program since updating, like keeping newly downloaded mail or bookmarks or history, or whatever else.  But hopefully, I see any major problem right away.]  At that point, they're identical, and I could run either one if I wanted.  Need something I permanently deleted from my POP3 Thunderbird account, for instance?  If it was there at the time of my last backup copy, I just close Thunderbird (""in-use"" copy), open Thunderbird (backup copy), and get it.  Simple. </p><p>If you find yourself wanting to test multiple configurations, or uninstalling and reinstalling particular software a lot, or trying to troubleshoot problems based on different set-ups, consider using the portable version of the same program if there is one. </p><p>Portable apps are good. </p><p>~ And that looks like a good end to a basic article.  Have a blessed life! ~ </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1309839;,pootmonkey,true,pootmonkey,1

How can any tool rewrite/redirect my FF BM's? What tool did this, the 3 plugins/addons I used above or hugedomains? If latter, do I need to report hugedomains to authorities? A last question: When I ran the bookmark checkers to validate the 2000 sites, does that pee-off the site admins as their sites are pinged?

I didn't let the system to hibernate properly and i forced the shutdown. Next thing i knew was that all of my firefox tabs are mute. Some programs doesnt even start. I tried to get around this by restarting and shutting down propoerly my pc. And it worked for a time. But it keeps happening. I searched around, and it seems to have something to do with PulseAudio, the very thing that was being used by simple screen recorder by the moment the battery ran out.

My favorites are all gone (I might have accidentally deleted them). I can do without the favorites. My bookmark (tabs?) are all gone. I never saw when I when I installed Firefox. I never set up a profile or anything like that. I had my old computer for 10 years or so and had to get this new one. Can I restore my old bookmarks? </p>,bookmarks;firefox-720;desktop;windows-7;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1309658;1309702;,neo-3,false,false,2
1285782,2020-04-30 16:15:36 -0800,2020-05-01T08:17:27Z,I deleted SSL security certificates from Thunderbird.  How can I replace them?,"<p>I've done my due diligence in an effort to find my answers on my own, but I have simply failed -- kind of like deleting many SSL security certificates was evidently its own failure.  I'll accept any deserved ragging that comes with earnest attempts at help :-P .  (I've spent the afternoon answering and replying to a number of others' questions in an attempt to, first of all help them, and then maybe even build up some measure of ""good karma"" to deserve help from others a little more *wink*.  But now, I need to get my question asked after days of off and on searching.)  This isn't the worst problem in the world right now, and I'm hoping the solution is actually easy for someone to provide. </p><p>I deleted SSL security certificates from Thunderbird.  How can I replace them? (Even just the ones that should come pre-installed in Thunderbird?  I don't expect anyone to know how or where I got any others, if I have.) </p><p>I tried copying cert8.db from a fresh install of Thunderbird, hoping that would reinstall the ""base"" certificates that come with it.  I've read about Mozilla's own security store but have not found a way to download or import from there. </p><p>Problems include: </p> <ul><li> Getting the 'Add Security Exception' dialog box for Gmail accounts -- which would not be a problem IF the 'Get Certificate' button worked, or IF the 'Confirm Security Exception' button (not ideal, but...) worked permanently with the 'Permanently store this exception' checkbox checked. </li><li> Some e-mail from restaurants and another source that have been sending me mail for a while just won't display their images any more, even after making an appropriate selection in the tooltip-yellow bar that asks about allowing resources to be downloaded.  I think the same thing happens in some USPS notifications as well. </li></ul> <p>That's all I can think of to add at this point.  By all means, please do prompt me for more information that might help, if needed.  You can write to me as someone versed in tech support and much general IT.
