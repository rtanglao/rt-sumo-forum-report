</p><p>I'm trying out Firefox for iOS v26 and when I open a new tab, I want to see my Bookmarks rather than Top Sites. The help section in the support pages here states that a New Tab can be configured to show a variety of different setups. However, in v26, Firefox Home, Blank Page and Custom URL are the only options displayed.
</p><p>Is this expected behaviour?
</p><p>I know I can browse through my Bookmarks to open the page I want, but it would be more convenient to have them displayed, just like I have setup in Safari.

1289090,2020-05-31 13:55:55 -0800,2020-05-31T14:05:49Z,Exporting digital certificate from Firefox Android,"<p>Hi, first time posting here.
</p><p><strong>A bit of background:</strong>
</p><p>Since the COVID19 situation, lots of procedures have to be done via the Internet, I, as a student, have rarely used digital certificates but now I'm trying to send an online application for a school scholarship and having trouble with it.
</p><p>In Spain, we've got what everyone calls the ""digital certificate"" is like a virtual ID, which I assume lots of countries have, in order to get it you need to register in the Gov. website, get some credentials and then get an appointment in an office just to get the definitive certificate. The thing is that I used to have one which expired (which I could download every time I needed it) but now they have changed the system and the new ones can only be downloaded once (and as a requirement you need to download it from the same browser, same device you got your credentials).
</p><p>I registered, downloaded, and auto-installed the certificate in Android Firefox 68.8.1 on Pocophone F1 (MIUI Global 11.0.4) and there's no way to export the certificate in order to install it on PC, which is what I need. It is not even installed on the phone as I cannot use it with other browsers, and as I told you before, there's no way to get another one (just by getting an appointment at the Gov. office, which is very complicated at the moment).
</p><p><strong>My question:</strong> Is there any possibility (rooting or not) to export the certificate in .pfx or .p12 format from Firefox Android? I do really need help with this.
</p><p>I tried to install some addons that were deprecated, keychains apps are not working either, searched some forums and found out that this is a thing asked to the Firefox team for a long time (?).
</p><p>Any tips and help are welcome! Thanks a lot and sorry for my English :).
</p><p>Just to clarify, I cannot download the certificate as it automatically installs the file into Firefox, if I do this procedure in another browser, the certificate shows as invalid.

remove the ~/.thunderbird directory,
copy the Mac Thunderbird directory to ~/.thunderbird,
move the ~/.thunderbird/Profiles/&lt;active-profile&gt;.default up a level to ~/.thunderbird,
remove the ~/.thunderbird/Profiles directory,
fix up (edit) various directory references in ~/.thunderbird/&lt;active-profile&gt;.default/prefs.js to correct for Mac-Linux file location differences,
also changed the app-version reference in the prefs.js to 68.8.0 (from the Mac's 68.8.1),
fix up (edit) the profile Path= references in ~/.thunderbird/profiles.ini,
similarly fix up (edit) the Default= reference in ~/.thunderbird/installs.ini

I do appreciate that this became a long standing battle, judging by the archived material but has the towel now been thrown in? Root cause seems to be that the Widevine plugin has been withdrawn from Firefox and that being so, there must be a good reason.
</p><p>When the question was archived with a tick was placed on the best answer. That the Widevine plugin can no longer be added from within Firefox, suggests to me that it is now game over. Am I being too pessimistic?
</p><p>I don't want work-arounds that never seem to last long in this area, ideally I am looking for a permanent fix on the lines that Google will co-operate and promise not to move the goal-posts without supplying the information needed to Mozilla in order to update Firefox first, so that the Widevine plugin can be made available once again and all be covered under Linux updates.
</p><p>An outright refusal in the above assessment, if correct, would at least demonstrate that the matter was political and that the solution to it is necessarily political too. Something that could likely gain traction in Europe at least.

</p><p>I play an online game called Elvenar by Innogames.
For some reason I cannot use my Firefox browser to play the game.  I can acess the login website, I can login to my game just fine but when the actual game page opens up none of the game graphics load, there is a black screen.
I can see the game menus on the gameplay screen, which are located around the perimeter of the screen and I can access the game toolbar, settings menu and I can log out using the game menu but again, no game graphics display, only a black screen.  I've tried updating the browser, clearing cache etc and nothing works.
Is there something else I can do to fix this issue?

</p><p>2 - I belong to ""many"" different Amateur Radio related Yahoo and <a href=""http://Groups.io"" rel=""nofollow"">Groups.io</a> forums and thusly have filters created to move emails upon receiving emails from each forum to a folder created for that forum.

It does not matter if I am in Inbox when shutting Thunderbird down!

The old email data was placed into a folder called ""Incoming Mail"", and I want to transfer those emails into sub folders. There are a few problems: 1 = Each of the sub folders is duplicated, with the second sub folder having numbers in its name. The emails have been spread over both sub folders for some reason. 2 = I can't create new sub folders or delete empty ones. I was able to move a few sub folders from the ""Incoming Mail"" folder, but could only place them in the ""Drafts"" folder. I've tried to move or create new sub folders in the ""Inbox"" since then, but nothing happens. I've also tried drag and drop and nothing happens. 
</p><p>I have no idea where to go from here. Even the guy who did the data transfer doesn't know why this is happening. Is this a common problem and can anyone help - the folder structure as it is is unworkable. Copy of the screenshot is below. Thanks Graham

</p><p>En el dia  de ayer Firefox para PC se colgo en una PC que tiene una CPU de 3.7 ghz,y 4 gigas de RAM.
Si bien Firefox navegaba rapido y con soltura pero de golpe se colgo algo que no es comun, intente hacer un shell con ctrl +alt y F1 para usar otros comandos en la terminal pero tampoco respondio al teclado por lo que directamente pulse el boton fisico de reiniciar el equipo.
El sistema operativo es Linux Mint 19.3 
En ese momento tenia dos ventanas abiertas una era privada y en este estaba reproduciendo el streaming de la Nasa TV via youtube. 
Ese problema no es comun, ya configure el navegador para que borre las cookies cada vez que cierro la aplicacion y otro problema que tengo es con el mouse porque por momentos se bloquea con interrupciones de 1 segundo mas o menos a pesar de haber borrado las cookies donde sospecho estaria el problema.

</p><p>If I hit Cntrl-H like I would in Chrome, I get a frustratingly limited view.  Why does it not show timestamps? So I spend time searching and find out about the Library window, and Control+Shift+H.  Okay, so that's at least making it possible to see timestamps.  Typing this right now, I don't remember if I had to manually add a column to see timestamps, but if I did Jesus Christ.  I nearly installed some other software (MZHistoryView) before finding out about Control+Shift+H, just to see timestamps.
</p><p>Also, every time I press the awkward Control+Shift+H hotkey, it resets the view to ""Today"".  I don't know why it wouldn't default to ""Just keep scrolling for as many days as you want"".  If I search for a specific site immediately after opening the window, then it includes entries for more days than just today.  But before searching, it cuts off my view to just today. What's the point of that? Who would want such a restriction as the default view?

When Firefox restarts, that page does not show up but I can see the calls being made from the server logs and noticed that there are a number of children processes under firefox, like:
</p><p>/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/plugin-container.app/Contents/MacOS/plugin-container -childID 6 -isForBrowser -prefsLen 56 -prefMapSize 258337 -sbStartup -sbAppPath /Applications/Firefox.app -sbLevel 3 -sbAllowAudio -sbAllowWindowServer -parentBuildID 20200507114007 -appdir /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/Resources/browser -profile /Users/cyboBook/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/uoc2ga4o.default 2467 gecko-crash-server-pipe.2467 org.mozilla.machname.937263303 tab
</p><p>I'm not sure which one is the one with the script but, after going down one by one, I usually kill the one with the calls before killing all the active tabs.
</p><p>The ""Restore previous session"" checkbox is off in the System Preferences so, when I restart the browser, I don't see my previous session, which is what I want.  However, it seems like firefox is restarting previous tabs anyway but not showing or rendering them so they are only partially restarted--enough so that the javascript starts running but not enough so I actually see that a web page exists and is causing a runaway script in the background.
</p><p>This seems like a bug to me.  Not sure how long a fix will take but, in the meantime, Question: can I/should I clear out the directory that has data for firefox to restore the session that I don't to have restored?  Is it in the .../Profiles/XXXXX.default file (on OSX)?

</p><p>I just came back to using Firefox for a Web Browser, I like it. However I Note there is something seriously missing here from a usability point in the Browser caused by lack of settings in the Home Section.
</p><p>In Firefox, Options, Home Section you have only 2 choices  a Section Called ""Home Page and New Windows"" and ""New Tabs"" this is the area that needs to be fixed and here is why.
</p><p>The Choices in the Home Section, New Windows and Tabs should have a 3rd New Option added called Simply ""Startup Pages"". The new Home Section would have 3 options as listed below.
</p><p>""Home Page"" (an option to input a Single URL)
""New Windows and Tabs"" (again an option to input Single URL or an option for a Radio Button to ""Use Home Page Settings""
A new One Called ""Startup Pages"" ( An option for user to put in a Single URL or Mutliple URL's seperated by a PIPE simple for Multiple Pages. This new Option called Startup Pages should only load When you Start Firefox by clicking on the Desktop Firefox ICON of the ICON for the Firefox Program)
</p><pre>Case In Point.
When I startup Firefox I want to have it open Multiple Pages so I have what I need, this saves me time and avoids me opening what I want loaded EVERY TIME I use Firefox. You give us that option currently in a setting called ""Home Page and New Windows"" However you also use this when a user clicks on the Home ICON on the toolbar or open a New Window.
</pre>
<p>I and others do not want multiple pages to load each time I select the Home ICON as they are already open and most users want those STARTUP Pages to remain Open while they Browse. I also do not want my Multiple Pages to Open when I select a new WINDOW or new TAB. in the current setup you can quickly have the same pages open many many times based on the current interface options in the Home Section.
</p><p>When a user wants to open Multiple Pages at Startup, they Most Generally do not want their multiple pages set in Firefox Options, Home, Home and New Windows to reopen when you want a simple NEW Window or Select the Home Page ICON. Most Users, myself included, want only a single web page to open when selecting the Home Icon in the Toolbar or When Selecting to Open a New Window, and generally users want it to be a Search Engine Page or Firefox Default Web Page. The new Microsoft Edge Browser also has issues with this type of operation and omits settings to accomplish my request. 
</p><p>Unfortunately GOOGLE CHROME does have options to achieve the Settings Separately and they have settings for Show Home Button, which let's you set a URL or New Tab Page, if New Tab Page is selected it simply Opens Up the Google Search page, Startup Page(s). They also have an Option and settings for On Startup where you can set a single page or Multiple pages. In Google Chrome if you want to open a new Window it simply opens the Google Chrome Search Page. 
</p><p>In closing I really like the new Firefox, You have done a Great Job and it is Light Years better than the New Edge Browser or Google Chrome, however to make it Really Rock and BEST IN CLASS for Operations I am hoping you can make changes to the Firefox Options, Home section to allow a more flexible and sensible operation of the Firefox Browser for Home, New Window or Tab and Startup, this would be Awesome and I do not think it would be a Major Change in the Code by adjust the Home Settings and adding a new Option
</p><p>Thank you for Consideration of this Feature Request, please keep up the Great Work.

For the most part each feed will show images the same as my brand X. There is one feed in particular that shows no images - just a brief summary of the the article and the link up above in the header whihc takes me to the website article. The web reader has a full pic for this thread not sure why this particular feed doesn't show images in TB.
</p><p>The question has to do with nearly all my feeds that have pics showing in the right side reading pane where the article shows up. Under view I have =&gt; Display Attachments inline. Any emails I receive with images are blocked and I need to manually chose =&gt; Show Remote Content I understand this doesn't have anything to do with inline image and is for security. Therefore since images are appearing in the RSS feeds I assume they are not remote content but are embedded images otherwise they would be blocked? If I disable EDIT: =&gt; Display Attachments - the images in the RSS feed are no longer visible. 
</p><p>I question if there is a security risk to be showing the inline images. Going back to the web reader there is an option to =&gt; Securely tunnel images thru brand X proxy - therefore the images that automatically show up are being downloaded from brand X back end server and my web browser retrieves them from brand X server not the RSS sender supposedly preventing any personal data from being sent back to RSS sender. 
</p><p>If downloading inline images are a security / privacy risk why are they not blocked by default in TB like the remote content?
</p><p>I am computer illiterate to a certain extent though I have every possible privacy add-on and about:config modification done to firefox and a few adjustment to the config editor in TB as well to limit exposure. Are the inline images a prviacy threat? (not even getting into malware or viruses yet.)

Any ideas how to fix this problem?

Pinholes make p.poor peepholes.  You have no idea the rage such stupidity can generate in such a mild guy as I (I actually am, but I have limited tolerance with stupidity).  That means others will be even less pleased and you'll  miss seeing the large astronomical body heading for your head.
First, let me clue you in that e-mails sent via FF. aren't as wide on the right as e-mails sent via M.S.  It took years for me to realize that that was the reason why certain e-mails to the VA weren't working!  
In all other matters I was happily using ver. 75 (?) for many, many years.  Then, through a less than clear process, I ended up with version 76!  Trying to ape the ""cool"" crowd is usually NOT a good idea!  Stick with building an easy to use and solidly better product that works.  Forego the flim-flam ""cool"" crap of your competitor and people will beat a highway to your door!  Which brings me back to v. 76.....
After considerable effort it finally was beginning to show some promise, but trying to make adjustments, starting with the tiny, tiny print was becoming an exercise in frustration, fury and futility!  Who in your organization is stupid enough to think this is OK?  I suggest you collect their belongings immediately and escort them to the door! 
I was trying to customize that work (v. 76) in progress, but ........ I give up!  There's no useful assistance info either, not even something a masochist would grudgingly use!  I'd be happy to be able to return/revert to v. 75. Just show me the way.  I can even learn to live with the level of 'ads' in e-mails that v. 75 has.   This was the original poison in the well, and they weren't winning.  
So, it's up to you.  I detested µSoft from their beginnings in chicanery and still do, but if I have to deal with that cesspool, I'll just get a bigger nasal clip and do the best I can.

I am a total unexperienced with this whole digital chaos.
</p><p>Let me start beginning, i changed a few months ago from chrome to edge, at least i tried, only a few minutes said microsoft and everthing would be the same but in this special browser for Windows 10 special.
I started at 16.00, only 5 minutes microsoft said, and ended at 00.4 in the morning later.
From about 60 passwords i got back 5, from porn sites.
Any way there was more damage made then in 5 minutes away from edge.
Then you have to call a so called it student company hoe comes at your home now they also use teamviewer.
And after the kid has to find out all kinds of trouble so after 3 hours i was back with chrome and 100 euros gone.
I have two questions.
In windows you can choose your browser,  and when i want firefox i se that there are 2 firefox .
And they are different, i think one has to go, cause my vpn doesnt works aigaints one and one says you dont use firefox as default brser and one of the 2 says the opposit.
I am sure that one of the two has to go or am i paranoid thanks to the bullshit that 70% of the common people also got after these every time chanching invite the most stupid and useless nonses.
Well i am sure that you will have no idea what i mean cause thats another bad change, you talk with machines, nobody can help me with instalating gpwin , pgp.,
And also, i have so many questions that it would take 1 week to explain by writing.
Why cant we talk with people anymore, exccept apple i heard. i am thinkgen to by my next lap there, i have an i pad that never has problems and this shit from microsoft en these these fuckbook ang google is greatest monster.
Have a nice day and i see if i ever get answer. that would be a wonder.
Dont give me links with days studiying cause i dont want to learn, i am totaly not intersted in it, but i am forced by society.

</p><p>This issue has recurred intermittently over the last couple of days, several days after the last Thunderbird update. It did not immediately start after the last update. Today it is recurring every time I try to send an email from a certain account. Receiving email is usually not affected.
</p><p>I have no issues with my Yahoo account. The troubled account settings are as pictured below. 
</p><p>I have already gone through tech support with Bluehost. They see no errors at their end and they sent me here. But it does seem that if Thunderbird were really causing the problem, by not sending the password correctly, that should happen with all my mail servers, not just one. 
</p><p>I already tried deleting both the mailbox and SMTP passwords in the password manager, and then saving them afresh with a freshly set password. No difference.
</p><p>Before this issue, I had not made any changes to my server settings in at least a year. Here are the outgoing server settings:
</p><p>Description: &lt;empty&gt;
Server name: <a href=""http://box850.bluehost.com"" rel=""nofollow"">box850.bluehost.com</a>
Port: 465
Connection security: SSL/TLS
Authentication method: Normal password
</p><p>The username is irrelevant and has not been changed. It still matches my domain name at Bluehost. 
</p><p>I tried changing the connection security setting to STARTTLS. That automatically changed the port to 587, but it made no difference to the issue. 
</p><p>I added Thunderbird to my Windows firewall permissions. It's very strange that it wasn't there already! But that did not resolve the issue either -- and it shouldn't have, since I didn't remove Thunderbird from the list. I had never brought up that dialog before today.
</p><p>A related page here suggested turning off various levels of Antivirus software. I use Avast Security. It doesn't seem to have any setting that would restrict outgoing emails. And if it were restricting something, the Thunderbird error message should be something more like ""Unable to reach server"", not a login failure message. And it should affect all email accounts that use the same settings. I have another username at the same server and I see that that account is suffering from the same issue. 
</p><p>Another related page suggests deleting three files from my default profile, logins.json and a DB file or two. That would seem to get rid of all kinds of stuff that shouldn't be gotten rid of. I hear this kind of advice from bank CSRs, telling me to delete all my cookies. That makes me want to blow my cookies at the CSR! They have no idea how many websites I would have to re-enter my information for if I were to delete all my cookies. 
</p><p>When I press Cancel in response to the ""Retry / Enter new password / Cancel"" message, another error message pops up:
</p><p>""Sending of the message failed.
Failed due to unexpected error 80004005. No description is available. 
The message could not be sent using Outgoing server (SMTP) <a href=""http://box850.bluehost.com"" rel=""nofollow"">box850.bluehost.com</a> for an unknown reason.

</p><p>Ao copiar uma imagem do computador ou diretamente de uma página web e colá-la no campo de mensagem do whatsapp web usando o firefox, a imagem copiada aparece no campo de mensagem, porém não aparece o ícone no whatsapp web para enviar a imagem, e assim a imagem não é enviada.
</p><p>Já no chrome esse ícone aparece e consigo enviar a imagem.
</p><p>Para enviar imagens pelo whatsapp web usando o firefox, é preciso primeiro baixar e salvar a imagem no computador, clicar no ícone do clips do whatsapp web, navegar no computador até o diretório onde a imagem foi salva, selecionar a imagem, e clicar em enviar. Esse procedimento não é rápido e nada prático, e nào permite copiar/colar imagens diretamente de alguma página web.
</p><p>Caso o firefox permitisse o copiar/colar assim como o chrome permite, seria muito mais rápido e prático esse procedimento de enviar imagens pelo whatsapp web.
</p><p>Essa falha ocorre no firefox na janela normal e também na janela privativa.

</p><p>when i do some posting on some random forums, it always totally randomly cuts off half of the posts and even adds totally random phrases from the same post into totally random places, so the post gets either cut off or really hard to even understand because all of the text scrambling in it...
</p><p>and that's not even all - now i edited some old wordpress post and then noticed that it has done the same exact word scrambling in it... so it's really hard to understand what is being said in 1 sentence again...
</p><p>so why is it happening and how can i fix it?

My tests seem to point to a security loophole with Cached Web Content.
</p><p>Question: how can I ensure privacy settings are honored, or, if there is a loophole, how can I get Firefox to also clear Cached Web Content on close?
</p><p>In my repeated test cases, I used bing to search for '5/8 irrigation kit', then closed the browser and reopened. Cookies and site data show 0 bytes (see attached images), Cached Web Content show something greater than 0.
</p><p>Next, I go to <a href=""http://bing.com/news"" rel=""nofollow"">bing.com/news</a>, scroll through stories, and see an advert for an irrigation kit as one of the sponsored adverts.
</p><p>As a further test after the original search, I try the following to see if I was being track another way, with the same resulting sponsored advert showing:
</p>
<ul><li> Restarted laptop
</li><li> Restarted ONT (to get a new IP) and wifi 
</li></ul>
<p>The following 2 scenarios seemed to resolve the issue after the original search and seeing the same resulting sponsored advert:
</p>
<ul><li> Turned on VPN
</li><li> Cleared Cached Web Content
</li></ul>
<p>Clearing Cached Web Content seems to be the solution, and a possible privacy loophole. Cached Web Content is not part of the auto-delete-at-close feature.
</p><p>Oddly, I haven't been able to consistently replicate the above starting with the VPN on and having it on through the tests. It sometimes shows the same resulting sponsored advert, and sometimes not.
</p><p>I tried to replicate this with Safari. It's auto-delete feature at close and similar privacy setting seems to work according to what I would expect with the same test scenario; which is, no previous search-informed sponsored advert.

&lt;input type='Password' name='Password' class='Full'&gt;

In the Zimbra Web front end of my account it is gone from both the spam and trash folders. With one Thunderbird I deleted it a second time, and it came back again. Now I see it in both Thinderbird instances in both spam and trash folders but not in the Zimbra Web front end. But what I see, is incomplete. Only a time (which changes to the actual time after each restart) and an unread mark is shown, no subject, no sender and no text. Sometimes it disappears when leaving and reentering the folders, but comes back after restart. I tried the msf repair funktion, but also this didn't help.

- obvious ""Restore previous session"" restore in options
- about:config turning various options:

None of these measures helped. I thought that It may be connected to XFCE session store somehow, so I went through disabling that too - no change. No other program happens to do the same.

Settings includes add-ons that were installed as well as whether or not they were enabled as well as the individual settings for each add-on.
</p><p>In other words, I would truly like to avoid updating Firefox unless I have at least a couple of days to waste.  When I used to have things set so I would merely be informed when a new FF update is available whenever I start or restart FF, it seemed that FF was so unhappy with me not paying attention to it that it would cause problems with other applications or system utilities.
</p><p>I have no reason why something caused FF to break other things just because I might have decided not to update it more than once a week.  I cannot see how any new release short of Ff r68 (or whatever the point of no return with Quantum was) or a bug fix of epic proportions that I should be eagerly awaiting should mess things up if I decide not to bother with it immediately.
</p><p>The deleted add-ons and strange new settings/configuration situations caused by FF upgrades could be easily remedied without causing users much if any stress if they had an option to make a full backup of the current FF installation with all installed add-ons (active or not), settings, etc. to a user-specified directory and filename.
</p><p>That way, users could always revert back a release or three if they found something horribly wrong with the latest update that they did not notice in the previous recent update(s).
</p><p>What would make things much easier for me and many others I am sure would be upgrades that changed no user custom configurations back to some defaults that render the UI almost unrecognizable and initially useless without a lot of restoration work.   For example, why do the text menus I often use keep going away after updates occur?  Why do I have to avoid following links to what might be interesting Web sites because all the the security and privacy enhancement add-ons I trust and know how to use from long experience have gone missing?
</p><p>For me, a Web browser is the home of my UI to the Web and most of the tools, accessories, and links I find most useful on the Web.  Essentially, the way I have FF set up by choice makes it my own personalized Web portal because even the Google Search page became too cluttered with announcements, disclaimers, and other distractions, when a simple Web query tool with an option for more advance queries was all I wanted.
</p><p>Is there a way that I can quickly make this release of FF (r76.01) look, act, and function the same as the previous release did tend days ago?  I mean I should not notice anything different now that I cannot adjust or bypass so that I only have to worry about important changes, such as enforcement of HTTPS:-only which I was doing with an EFF add-on long before it was built into FF.
</p><p>Using the above analogy, would most FF users who deal with landlords, property management, or HOAs be thrilled if every time they came home from work they found the landscaping had changed, new interior decorations applied in every room, and their favorite comfortable furniture not where they left it, but it moved to different locations that do not fit well with their usual household routines (or maybe just thrown out entirely)?
</p><p>I have nothing against meaningful changes to improve functionality, performance, or appearance; but having those changes made in one's carefully configured environment for use in conjunction with the Web for no important reason and without the ability to undo the majority of what has changed in ten minutes (maybe an hour for alterations necessitated by the Web itself changes suddenly at times of, oh say, the worst pandemic since before the first nodes on what is now known as the Internet were linked and communications established between them?
</p><p>I would be thrilled if my list of installed add-ons (enabled or not) never changed unless there were some that truly would not work because of some necessary part of an browser upgrade.  Ditto for the way I like text menus and dislike icons or entirely missing menus for about the same reason I dislike trying to make sense of Chinese road and building signage circa 1860.
</p><p>I doubt I will bother to gripe about difficult to (mostly) repair Firefox upgrades a third time a few months from now, because the hassles they cause will probably be more irritating to me than caving in like most sheople and using some Chrome variant browser.
</p><p>Really, I would like to know how to get as close to what I had in Firefox about ten days ago, excepting only absolutely necessary differences.  It would be miraculous if I could repair the look, feel, and functionality that was lost in the upgrade to FF r76.01, especially if I could do the work in less time than it takes most people reading this rant to figure out that I do not enjoy proofreading, especially when there are riots in the streets in many U.S. cities, live on TV ... just what we need during an economic crisis caused by an ongoing pandemic.

When TB asks ""compact now?"" I usually delay a bit until I can organize my open tabs, because they always go empty after compacting. After I get the open tabs taken care of I do the compact via right click on Inbox. Today I've been getting ""ALERT The folder 'Inbox' could not be compacted because writing to folder failed. Verify that you have enough disk space, and that you have write privileges to the file system, then try again."" 
Several problems, I don't know what ""writing to folder failed"" means. The only place I see disk space is under settings and there is no option to see or verify ""enough"" and I cannot find anywhere to look at/change ""write privileges."" I stopped Bitdefender from doing anything with TB some time ago. 
Maybe it's not a problem? But from reading TB info, it seems to be an important function. Thanks much. Barb

Is there any way to block A2HS notifications from certain website (or even all of them)?

</p><p>Edit (04/06/2020):
This issue lasted a day, and the many notifications were due to the news website reloading every 4 minutes or so, other websites only had it being displayed once. After that day I haven't had any more A2HS notifications.

It is on my iMac running Catalina OS15. History: Last week, after I changed my AT&amp;T/Yahoo email password, I had difficulty getting Thunderbird to accept the new password. I tried different server settings as well as creating a new profile and new accounts. Finally, AT&amp;T support set up a security key, which allowed me to access my Thunderbird incoming email and to send outgoing email.
</p><p>In setting up a new profile or account, I lost all of my saved folders. I was finally able to restore them from my Profile folder, but made mistakes during my attempts. I may have restored from the wrong Thunderbird folder, stored either in Documents or Library. Lots of extra system type files were imported as you can see in the first screen shot. I put them in the trash, but it won’t empty.  The second screen shot shows the side bar with 3 different In/Out/Trash folders. Only one has my saved folders.  Several hundred emails were downloaded from the server into the Inbox. However, the date range is only since the problem began, even in the Inbox above the saved folders. The third screen shot shows Tool/Account Settings which may show the extra local folder.
</p><p>Lastly, I lost my other two identities that I had set up. I’m sorry this is long-winded, but hope the information helps someone to help me to clean up this mess. 
</p><p>Thanks,
Delilah

I then went to Lockwise and again, same (old) User ID and Password; however, in the Lockwise App under about Logins, it shows the NEW User ID and Password.  I do not understand what that indicates as it is not used to login to the browser, monitor or Lockwise.  Let me emphasize I am Semi-Computer literate, but nowhere near a techie, so any thoughts and help would be appreciated.  Thanks.

First one went fine and in the process was presented the 'Sign In with your Google Account' prompt screen.  Email account name was automatically populated and after selecting 'Next' all I needed to do was to enter my Google password.  Account installed fine and Thunderbird/Google did their 'hand-shake' and my emails were downloaded into Thunderbird.  Off to a good start!  Looking from the Google Account side of things, it showed 'Mozilla Thunderbird Email' under 'Third-party apps with account access.' So I considered this one done...
</p><p>Getting my subsequent Gmail account added didn't go so well as I couldn't get past the 'Sign In with your Google Account' prompt screen.  The Email account name was auto-populated as before, but selecting 'Next' didn't get me to what should have been the enter password screen.  It simply 'cleared' the account name and sat there.  Trying to enter the account name manually didn't get me anywhere.  
</p><p>This occurred for the couple of the Gmail accounts I tried and they all were 'fine' using WLM and/or Web access to the respective Google accounts.

2) how it decides which one it will load this time

</p><p>I've just switched my IMAP emails from Fossamail to Thunderbird 68.8.1 (32-bit), on three Windows 10 (x64) devices.  On each device, the DATE and RECEIVED columns are displaying new emails with the wrong date and time yet the Date inside the email headers is correctly shown.
</p><p>Example:
Today's date is Fri 29 May 2020 and it's now around 10:54
Date in email source ie CTRL+U shown as:   Thu, 28 May 2020 22:43:58 -1000
TB Columns display:  Received 09:43       Date 09:43
</p><p>I'm in UK.  The regions and dates on each Windows device is displayed correctly but per online advice I've changed regions to Hawaii (ie UTC -10:00) then back to UK (ie UTC +00:00) after closing TB.
It made no difference.
</p><p>I also use two Android devices when on the move.  Both show the correct Date as 22.44 on 28th May.
</p><p>Can someone please guide me through this confusion?  Ironic that I switched from Fossamail because it wasn't supported anymore (support was never needed) and now I need support after switching.
</p><p>Thanks in hope!

</p><p>I hope someone can help with this. I've recently developed a HTML Template for an e-mail newsletter which is sent via mailmerge using Thunderbird. The HTML Template doesn't attach images to the e-mail when it's sent, so the images are hosted on an existing website.
</p><p>When I send the HTML Template using Thunderbird, the file size is over 200kb - which is a problem given Gmail cuts off sections of e-mails which are over 102kb in size.
</p><p>What's stranger is that when we input the same HTML Template and send as an e-mail via Gmail or even a basic webmail app like Roundcube (cPanel) - the e-mail size is more like 60kb to 80kb.
</p><p>I've even tried sending the e-mail from Gmail to Thunderbird (which arrives at around 60kb), and then sending that same e-mail from Thunderbird, which then increases the size to around 160kb.
</p><p>We've tried sending the e-mail individually from Thunderbird and using the mailmerge extension, and in both cases, the size of the e-mail is much larger than when the same code is sent from a different e-mail provider.
</p><p>Is there something about Thunderbird which is causing this to happen!?
</p><p>Many thanks for any help!

En bas à droite, apparaissait un message indiquant que ma connexion avait été réinitialisé qui n’apparaît plus désormais. Sous courrier entrant, les onglets ""brouillons, modèles, envoyés et corbeille""ont disparu. J'ai tenté de réinstallé la dernière version de thunderbird, de supprimer le compte puis de le réinstaller, mais rien n'y fait.

I'm gonna need help walking through this....when I was in college, the computer sci majors were learning to program with keypunch.

So, here i am, asking you where to look on the FireFox browser settings, or anywhere else that may be of help.

The Lightning calendar is actually my primary use of Thunderbird, I installed it just for the calendar. Most of the time, I launch T-Bird just to check my calendar.
Because incoming e-mails are always a distraction in my workflow, I was wondering if there was any way of using Lightning *without* Thunderbird, i.e. a separate application basically. Indeed on one of my PCs I haven't set up an e-mail account in TB, but just my CalDAV calendars. This way, the e-mail setup wizard greets me  each time I want to look at my calendar.
On my other PC, I have my e-mail account configured, and I can make it so that the Lightning tab is in the foreground when starting TB, but still the e-mail tab is open and e-mails are downloaded in the background.
I don't mind having TB installed and using it for my e-mail is also fine I'd just like to <em>launch</em> them separately, so nothing e-mail related happens whenever I use Lightning.
I sthere any way to accomplish that?

The issue is that the webpage links will not work, for example, on <a href=""https://www.vans.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.vans.com/</a> trying to use the side filter when scrolling through products does not work, you can click on them (say if you wanted to filter for slip on shoes) but the link acts like text. I've also noticed this on <a href=""https://optcorp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://optcorp.com/</a> (a telescope website) where if you tried to click on a link from one of the tabs (say Telescopes -&gt; Professional Telescopes) it doesn't do anything. Oddly enough it does show the full link in the bottom left corner so right clicking to open in a new tab works but just clicking it doesn't. 
</p><p>I've cleared my cache and had Firefox refresh and the issue is still there, I'm not sure what could cause the issue.

I ended the firefox session again, and did a restart of windows for good measure, hoping to get everything restored.

Things looked ok, so I ended that session, and tried restarting again, hoping to restart normally, without SAFE MODE on. I got the same two options again - SAFE MODE or REFRESH. So, I thought REFRESH would get me back to my prior session. Nope. That reloaded a bunch of things, like bookmarks, etc. and gave me a new session.

I have my Windows 10 taskbar set to auto-hide, so that it reappears when I hover the mouse over its location. This works for all programs but Thunderbird. When I have Thunderbird in expanded (full screen) window mode, hovering over the taskbar area does not make the taskbar reappear. The only way I can see it is to minimize the Thunderbird window. 
</p><p>I had found a solution for this that worked for months, but I can't find it now. Today I found this archived topic:
</p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1271091"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1271091</a>
</p><p>I set all the options as recommended in this article, although some of them seem irrelevant. I was so pleased that it solved the problem. Except that two hours later, the problem returned. I hadn't restarted the computer in the meantime, although the screen had turned off automatically in the meantime. I checked that all the settings were still as recommended in the article. 
</p><p>I know this has been a recurring issue with Thunderbird, because it's been bothering me off and on for years, and I always see other people are bothered by it. (I've also seen complaints about this happening with Firefox, which I no longer use.) 
</p><p>Usually I see the issue blamed on Windows, but it doesn't happen with Microsoft Office, any of several browsers, my photo editing software, Netflix, Youtube, or indeed with no other program but Thunderbird. It's hard to believe the fault lies with Windows. I could work around it by not using Thunderbird in fullscreen window mode, but that means the two window modes are practically the same size, and I really do sometimes want a smaller email window and sometimes a larger window. I would like to be able to shift between the two modes without losing my Windows taskbar.

</p><p>When I use Firefox to open a .pdf file that is long and ""heavy"" (it's a 600 page book scan with OCR), searching with Ctrl+F gets sloppy. Searching clearly skips some of the appearances of the phrase. I compared the results with other .pdf readers as well as Chrome. The latter one, for example, brings 190 search results while Firefox makes it 172. With more specific search, it's 3 to 2 or sometimes 1 to none.
</p><p>I believe the reason is that file doesn't load entirely upon opening - rather, it loads pages as I'm scrolling. Even though Firefox has some useful features as a .pdf reader that Chrome lacks, like two pages view, this flaw alone kind of kills it for some uses.
</p><p>Is there any fix for this? Like maybe forcing Firefox to load an entire document at once?
</p><p>Cheers,
Rafał

Usually with other apps you can bring the program to the correct monitor and close it there then it opens there as well. I move FF around from time to time but my main monitor gets the most use. To test this weird issue, I moved FF to the second monitor and tried printing there, the dialog shows up on my main LOL. What causes the print dialog to show up on the wrong screen, or even why does it always choose another screen other than the one FF is being displayed on? Is there a setting or option to correct this? The reason this is problematic is I don't always turn on the second on, so if i want to print a receipt or something I have to turn on the second monitor(which for me takes a bit, first the main blanks out then second turns on then first ""catches up""). I hope someone can point me in the right direction.

Agora eu pergunto: <strong>para que toda essa paranoia?</strong> Vocês veem a Google deletando canais ou contas de Gmail só porque alguém redefiniu sua senha? é claro que não! você veem a Microsoft deletar as contas de seus usuários no One Drive ou Xbox Live só porque eles se esqueceram de sua senhas e as redefiniram? De novo, a respostas é um sonoro <strong>NÃO.</strong> Enquanto isso, eu redefini minha senha no Opera Sync e recuperei meus favoritos sem problema algum.
</p><p>Me digam: seus servidores por acaso guardam informação super secreta para os militares dos EUA ou para alguma organização secreta? eu acho que não, certo? <em>então de novo eu pergunto, para que toda essa maldita paranoia com a segurança?</em>
</p><p>Ah, e antes que vocês comecem a reclamar, <em>eu não entendo de nada de computadores - eu só uso meu PC para navegar na Internet e jogar!</em> E eu só descobri sobre aquelas tais de ""chaves de recuperação"" <em>depois que eu havia redefinido minha senha.</em> <strong>EU NÃO DEVERIA PRECISAR DE UM MANUAL DE INSTRUÇÕES PARA USAR UMA DROGA DE BROWSER. ISSO DEVERIA SER ALGO TÃO SIMPLES QUANTO ANDAR.</strong>
</p><p>Eu não sei se será possível para vocês recuperar minha informação perdida - se for, ótimo, mas caso não seja, façam-me um favor e mudem a droga do Sync de modo que ninguém mais passe pela frustração e raiva por que eu passei, ok? Adoro o Firefox e detesto browsers like o Edge ou o Google Chrome e odiaria ter que começar a usar um desses só porque vocês preferem agir como um bando de idiotas paranóicos.

I have reviewed the current TB help forums however they seem to deal with whether or not an exchange server is being used. I've asked our IT guy if IMAP is enabled for this email account and am waiting a response. However I can receive email OK with the IMAP setttings so I have to believe that this is OK.

I while ago (actually quite a while) I posted about spam classification of incoming list emails from users with .eu tld's (and one or two others with much rarer occurence). Nothing I was able to think of doing would convince Thunderbird to accept them, until...
out of desperation I created a second profile with just one of my several emails - the one that exhibited the rejection behavior - as a Hail-Mary, and it worked. So now, I open TB with the second profile (with the only account that brings in that particular list mail), filter the ""offending"" emails into their proper folders (I keep everything!), then shut down and reopen with the main profile. It's a bit tedious.
My questions are:
1. Where does TB keep its profile definitions, and
2. What should I be looking for to prevent TB from rejecting emails with .eu or other hip and trendy, exotic tlds ?
</p><p>Many thanks

</p><p>With the increasing amount of phishing emails (and them getting better), I wonder if there is an option/extension in thunderbird, that helps me to faster decide if an Email is legitimate or not. It's about debunking the embedded links:
</p><p>I'd like to not only see the link text but always see the full hyperlink (or only the domain of it) directly in the mail-text. I know that the link-adress is shown at the bottom if I hover over the link, but sometimes I'm simply not fully attentive while reading my mail, so I forget to check this....
</p><p>e.g. Instead of the text "" now press &lt;&lt;here&gt;&gt;"" where &lt;&lt;here&gt;&gt; is the link, it would show ""now press <strong>domainname:</strong>&lt;&lt;here&gt;&gt;
</p><p>or enforcing that after pressing the link, a pop up opens that shows the domain name in bold and one has to press OK/not OK...
</p><p>I know that may render some emails rather unreadable, but maybe with a keyboard shortcut, one could then quickly disable it...
</p><p>Just thinking out loud... does this make any sense?

We've had a self-signed cert on our mail server(Mercury) for years and years.  The current one expires next week, so I created a new one and set it.  
</p><p>When I try and send an email, I get ""Sending of the message failed.  The certificate is not trusted because it is self-signed.  The configuration related to x.x.x.x must be corrected."".  While watching the mail server, I can see the STARTTLS connection and the eventual termination by Tunderbird.
</p><p>I then go to Tools-&gt;Options, then to Privacy &amp; Security.  Scroll down to Security, click the Manage Certificates button.  I switch to the Servers tab and I could see my old x.x.x.x:25 server, so I selected it and deleted it.  I then click Add Exception at the bottom, put in the exact server address(x.x.x.x:25) and click ""Get Cerfiicate"".  I immediately get a ""No Information Available  Unable to obtain identification status for this site"".  Of course, ""Confirm Security Exception"" is disabled.  Note, when I click ""Get Certficate""  I see NO connection to the mail server at all.  
</p><p>I reconfigured my account settings to be port 587 rather than 25 in case there's some weirdness there. When I try and send, of course, I get the same sort of connection activity on the server.  When I try Get Certificate from Add Security Exception, I get zero activity.
</p><p>What am I missing to get Certificate Manager to actually get the certificate from my mail server and allow an exception like it did 2 years ago(the last time I changed certs)?
</p><p>Note, I tried this on my Thunderbird 77.0b3 and another employees 68.8.1.  Both had the exact same result(no connection attempt from Get Certificate, meaning unable to continue).
</p><p>Note, Outlook on my bosses machine, the mail client on my phone(MIUI12s built in one), and my bosses iPhone all are working perfectly fine with the new cert(once it prompted to allow for the self-signed cert).  So I'm reasonably assured Thunderbird is the problem child here.  Yes, the cert has X509v3 extensions.

I've just moved over to Thunderbird from Outlook for my yahoo mail using the IMAP mail server settings.  However, I'm having a problem where the email folders are not staying synchronised correctly, even though all of the account sychronisation settings are turned on (as they were by default).
</p><p>The problem occurred when I use another device such as my phone or web mail to move emails to another folder.
For example, I receive an email which I see appear into my inbox on Thunderbird.  I then use my phone to move that email to a folder called ""Work related"".  I then go back to Thunderbird and I can see that the email has now correctly appeared in the ""Work related"" folder but it's also still showing in the inbox.  I.e. I have 2 copied of it, one in the inbox and another in the ""Work related"" folder according to Thunderbird!  I check this via webmail which confirms that the email has been moved corrrectly, so Thunderbird shouldn't be showing it in the inbox.
</p><p>I've tried clicking ""Get Messages"" to get it to update but it does nothing.  I've tried clicking to other folders and back again, but it doesn't change or update.
The only methods that I found which work are to either close Thunderbird and reopen it (it this case the email shows up initially in the inbox but quickly disappear as Thunderbird refreshes), or to right-click on the inbox, go to properties and ""repair"" the folder (a pain because it takes a while on the larger folders).
</p><p>Same thing happens moving things between other folders if I do it on another device.  I have to keep restarting Thunderbird to get it to show correctly!  Using Outlook it was always handled correctly, but I want to move over to an open source solution.
</p><p>Thanks in advance,
Steve

I logged in with one of my other email addresses not the one I normally use and synch on.
I find now that the app won't forget the other email.
I went on line from a pc and deleted the new account but the app still is trying to connect with the ""other"" e-mail address.  Tried deleting app and reinstling but still the same issue.  I guess the profile ifor the email address is held separately on the phone but I can't find it to delete it.

</p><p>Happy memorial day from our family to yours! Let us remember those courageously gave their lives. I have been using Mozilla Thunderbird for more than a decade, on multiple Operating Systems, and this is my first post in this great community. Overall, long time Mozilla user and a fan!
</p><p><strong>Goal</strong>:
</p><p>My objective is to keep only last N days of emails in order to save disk space. I would like to set up 2 gmail accounts. 
</p><p><strong>Expected Behavior</strong>:
</p><p>Right after setting up the email account, if I change settings from Synchronization &amp; Storage page to download emails from only most recent N days, Thunderbird should respect that setting. Most importantly, this setting should only limit the scope of downloading emails, and under any circumstances, should <strong>not</strong> delete emails on the remote server.
</p><p><strong>Actual Behavior</strong>:
</p><p>Right after setting up the email account, Thunderbird aggressively starts downloading emails regardless its size or age. If I change settings to sync most recent N days, I still see old emails. These old emails do not away - even after restating the application or even restating the computer. After referring to <a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">another post on this forum</a> I also tried using 'Compact folder' option followed by restating the application. It did not seem to do the trick.
</p><p><strong>The question</strong>:
</p><p>Given the above, I am wondering, somehow - if I changed Thunderbird's default Synchronization &amp; Storage settings to download only most recent N days' emails, would it help me achieve my goal? If it would, I would like to know how. 
</p><p>FWIW - I <em>might be</em> using Mozilla Thunderbird 68.8.1 (32-bit) portable, in Windows 7.
</p><p><em>P.S. : I am open to any approach that helps me achieve my goal.</em>

I don't have any emails in the ""email section"" of each contact I store all emails and phone numbers in the Notes section of each contact since its not unusual to have multiple emails and phone numbers for a contact I keep them in the Notes so i can make notes next to them. I have been doing this forever.
</p><p>When I begin to type an email apparently it matches the text I am typing with all data in the contacts Notes section not the ""email section"" (which are blank.) What I end up with in the auto-fill drop down menu is massive chaos. I have 900 contacts give or take 15 since they fluctuate.
</p><p>I went into Tools/Options/Composition/Addressing and unchecked all boxes it made no difference. I checked the box Directory Server / None thinking i can fool it into pulling from a non-server but that didn't do anything either. I have two address books each synced online with web based PIM.
</p><p>I dread having to compose email. The only way I found to stop the auto-fill is uncheck the address book in the left panel in Cardbook but then i cant search inside of cardbook when I need something I would need to keep checking and unchecking the address book before and after sending mail. I opened two windows with cardbook opened twicw tried using one window for email with the adjacent cardbook tab address book unchecked and another windows just for cardbook and calendar functions address book boxes checked but when i checked or unchecked the address book in one window it changed the other window as well so that doesn't work. I would rather type addresses in manually or copy and paste directly from each contact if i can just figure a way to turn off auto-complete. Any suggestions? Thanks.

</p><p>I then remembered the colors option in Firefox and went to options, fonts &amp; colors and changed the colors to a black font on a white page.

I decided to use this version of FF (52.8.1) because I've used it before with no problems on an even older laptop with Win XP. However, the experience is not pleasant to say the least.
</p><p>I'm attaching here some screenshots so we can see exactly what's going on. 
First image: 2 tabs, Yahoo mail, calendar = 1 GB of memory, 59% of CPU. 
Second image: 3 tabs, Yahoo mail, calendar, FB = 1.5 GB of memory, 55% of CPU. 
Third image: 1 tab, blank, after closing the other tabs = 725 MB of memory, 52% of CPU(!)
</p><p>At this stage, the <strong>very latest</strong> version of Chrome is actually less resource-heavy than this version of FF.
</p><p>I went ahead and did an experiment: <strong>exact same 6 tabs</strong> in Regular Mode vs. Safe Mode with add-ons disabled.
Fourth image: regular mode, 700 MB of memory.
Fifth image: safe mode, 420 MB of memory.
So, with all add-ons disabled, I save about 300 MB of memory, which is rather substantial (as a percentage) but not dramatic.
</p><p>I have ""hardware acceleration"" already disabled. Zero themes. My add-ons are very basic, an ad blocker, a translator, two pdf savers, a couple of video downloaders, and a cash back shopping button. 
</p><p>Btw, I tried the ""minimize memory usage"" and it freed up only 150 MB, so almost useless.
</p><p>I realize this is a recurring issue with FF and that many people report usage over 4-5 GB of memory. But you can see I don't have that much RAM, plus I thought this older version would be ""efficient"" with Win 7.
</p><p>Thank you for any suggestions!

(When I do the same in Safari, it also says ""creating pdf"", but then it switches to iBooks, showing the created document.)
</p><p>Further, when I view a PDF file on a page that requires me to log in, attempting to copy the PDF file to iBooks does create a file in iBooks, but iBooks says it can't read it. If I instead select a link to a PDF file and choose ""download"", then go to the downloaded files in Firefox's library and tap the file, Firefox itself cannot read it (it just displays a blank page). Note that this problem only seems to exist on pages where I have to log in. 
</p><p>In an attempt to find out what might be wrong in the second case, I opened a PDF file in Firefox, chose ""share with Mail"", sent it to myself, and had a look at it on my computer with BBEdit. It turned out that the contents of the file is actually html. It seems to be the html code of the login page. I get the same result when I look into one of the downloaded PDF files that Firefox has stored on the iPad.
</p><p>Thankful for any help, because I'd rather avoid having to switch to Safari,

Show up on all desktops etc., it interrupts me in what I’m doing. I really very strongly dislike this change.
</p><p>I would like to revert to how it was before (pre-76.0 ? Not sure exactly which version):
- notifications get sent to my desktop/OS’s notification center (running OpenSuse + KDE),
- no popup is displayed when a notification is triggered.
</p><p>That way:
- notifications will respect the OS « do not disturb » mode, 
- notifications get shown through a unified UI for all applications,
- I can pick how « interrupting » I want each notification to be,
- In particular I can focus while on my computer without being interrupted, and poll the notifications occasionally.
</p><p>Is there a way (maybe a about:config option) to keep notifications but disable the popup behaviour?

But then it pops up the denied because the video is age restricted error. I have double checked and don't have any age restrictions options selected (either in Firefox, Youtube or Google settings). I am over 50, so none of those 3 sites would be popping it up because it thinks I'm under age. All age restricted videos played perfectly fine before this latest update. I have cleared all cookes and cache, signed out and back in to Youtube and Google accounts and nothing helps. I can copy the exact link into Chrome and the video plays fine as normal.

It's not that it isn't working properly, it's that the mobile website you're viewing is a different address than the desktop site. For example, if I go to Kohl's on my desktop, the address is <a href=""https://www.kohls.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.kohls.com</a>. If I visit the site on mobile,it's <a href=""https://m.kohls.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://m.kohls.com</a>. Apparently the two sites are also entirely different, in that your desktop credentials won't work with the mobile site. Why that is I do not know, but this is not the first time I've discovered this problem with this, as well as other websites. The conclusion here is that this is not a Firefox problem, but rather a problem between some disparate websites which are not properly sharing login information between the desktop and mobile versions, and so if you run into this issue the only thing you can do is contact the owner of the website to let them know. It's also possible that this is simply a security feature and that you have to authorize mobile access, but of course the only way to find out is to ask. Enjoy the rest of your memorial day weekend.

</p><p>I've just had to restore my Pixel 4 from a Google backup after a hardware fault.  When I go to the screen to open a new blank tab, Firefox has reverted to displaying thumbnails for all the existing tabs.  I like to keep quite a few tabs open, so I had changed a setting so that Firefox displayed a list of already open tabs, rather than showing them as a series of thumbnails.  Unfortunately, as a result of having to re-install Firefox, I've lost that particular change.
</p><p>Can someone remind me what I have to change to get back to the list display.  I had it working just fine, but I  cannot remember how I did it, and I can't even find the solution after a fair bit of Googling.  :-(

I've just installed MacOS Catalina 10.15.4 and as soon as I ran Firefox i noticed that after a few minutes (variable)  it hangs when attempting to populate a new tab (with anything).  All other existing tabs are then blank (white screen with spinning grey wheel in the centre). Firefox worked fine on MacOS Mojave prior to the upgrade. 
</p><p>When this happens I can do nothing. If i press command-option-esc to show (and cancel) processes it shows 'Firefox (not responding)'. Firefox can be force quited and will be removed from the display but when I tap on the Firefox icon to restart it just bounces up and down and never starts. I am forced to attempt a shutdown of MacOS but when I issue a 'Shutdown' macOS never shuts down going to the desktop screen and having a spinning wheel. I am forced to press and hold the power button on my iMac (2.7 Ghz Quad-Core Intel Core i5, 8GB 1600 Mhz memory.... I know it's old but it conforms to the spec required for Catalina) to force a shutdown. 
</p><p>If I leave Firefox running unattended for a length of time (say an hour) I come back and find it locked up with the same behaviour. 
</p><p>Safari does not show any of these behaviours and works fine (but I want to continue using FF). 
</p><p>I have... 
1) Re-downloaded Firefox and re-installed. Same behaviour
2) Run in safe mode. Same behaviour 
3) Attempted to run with individual addons. Same behaviour
4) Created a new 'places' database. Same behaviour. 
5) Hardware acceleration is not enabled in 'about:preferences'.
6) Turned off 'Use Recommended Performance settings'. Same behaviour. 
7) Not changed the process limit (set to 8 (default)).
8) Checked for duplicated session restore files in the profile folder. There are none (no sessionstore-x.js1 files).
9) I am not using an Automated Proxy Configuration URL (the dialog is set to 'Auto-detect proxy setting for this network. Nothing else is set). 
9) Checked on the Activity Monitor for named Firefox processes at the restart attempt. None present but FF still won't start. 
10) Searched the web and found a few instances of (in Catalina Beta5) FF crashing on startup.

</p><p>(a quick PS: the all-caps words are all-caps-ed for emphasis on how unbelievable this is--I'm far more surprised than I am angry; I have faith in the Firefox community being able to solve this)
</p><p>To reiterate, despite the situation described above, ZERO tabs appear in the list of Synced Tabs! There is a (fairly meta) screenshot attached below which shows the empty Synced Tabs Sidebar.
</p><p>THINGS I have ALREADY tried:
1) I have tried signing out and signing back in on the Mac.
2) I have tried pressing/running a 'sync' on both devices.
3) I have searched for archived help files and found one suggesting I look for a ""userChrome.css"" file in the profile folder buried in the hidden view of my ~/library--I did this and found no such file.
4) I tried signing out and clicking on the 'sign-in to sync tabs' button IN THE Synced Tabs Sidebar ITSELF; I was able to login but... no change.
5) I tried RENAMING BOTH devices. The renaming synced on both sides, but THE TABS ARE STILL MISSING.  :/
</p><p>I've run out of immediate ideas... I turn to you, here, for help. Please help.

</p><p>Been running into a problem that has recurred in the last few days, trying to log into my Kindle account, as I do every day . . . I believe a day or so back I got a drop down message from possibly the ""lock"" icon on the left end of the address bar??  asking me ""Do you want to update your password""??  Since it was logging me in I thought FF was ""doing me a favor"" . . . so I clicked yes . . . .  Then, the next day perhaps, I was again logging in to Kindle via a different OS, so it didn't get the memo on the change . . . logged into Sync . . . and it gave the ""you gave us the wrong password""????
</p><p>I checked a flash drive where I used to have all of my passwords stored, and it should have been right, then I checked FF ""logins and passwords"" . . . and in Amazon listing was this emongus password that appeared to be auto-generated by FF???  I took the time to get Amazon to send me an ""update your password"" . . . did that.  Then again today, logging into Kindle, same deal, errors out . . . the message doesn't say, ""Would you like FF to generate a huge random password for this account?""  and again FF appears to have auto-generated a password . . . back from having just changed the password to what I thought was my own . . . FF has gone and changed it to a huge auto-generated line . . . .  It used to be that Synce would ""store"" your passwords, now it appears to be ""fixing them""???  possibly as a new ""feature"" of ""Lockwise""???  
</p><p>I'd like FF to ""store"" the passwords, not try to change them on me, by asking ""can we update your password?""  Plz help.

It syncs OK between different Firefox client (Linux, Windows 10...) but not with Android version.
I configured the identity.sync.tokenserver.uri like on the desktop versions by looking at about:config.
I double-verified configuration, but nothing sync. All the checkbox are grayed (see attached images)
As there isn't sync log like on desktop versions (about:sync-log), I looked at my Apache log instead, and it seems that something goes wrong.
Indeed, 
when a desktop client starts to sync, there are lines like:
192.xxx.xxx.xxx - - [23/May/2020:18:48:50 +0200] ""<strong>GET /token/1.0/sync/1.5 HTTP/1.1</strong>"" 200 3122 ""-"" ""Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:76.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/76.0""
or
77.xxx.xxx.xxx - - [23/May/2020:06:54:40 +0200] ""<strong>GET /token/1.0/sync/1.5 HTTP/1.1</strong>"" 200 3122 ""-"" ""Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:76.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/76.0""
but when android client starts to sync, it seems that url is incomplete (there isn't /token/1.0/sync/1.5 after GET):
92.xxx.xxx.xxx - - [22/May/2020:21:03:45 +0200] ""<strong>GET / HTTP/1</strong>.1"" 200 2579 ""-"" ""Mozilla/5.0 (Android 6.0.1; Mobile; rv:68.0) Gecko/68.0 Firefox/68.0""
I suspect this is the problem, but I can't understand why.
Your help would be greatly appreciated!

I am drafting an email and I am pasting some verbiage from another document. The problem occurs when I forget to use ""paste without formatting,"" and instead use ""paste.""  Because the added text retains the format of the source that I don't want, I ""undo"" the paste. When doing this, Thunderbird removes a lot more than just the immediate paste. Sometimes, it removes everything I have typed over some time span, perhaps several minutes. This time, I was editing a previously written paragraph by adding some text and the ""undo"" removed not only the edits, but the entire paragraph, while retaining edits to prior paragraphs that sequenced between the original draft of the paragraph that was deleted and the edits to that paragraph. This ""undo"" problem seems to occur only after performing a paste, not when undoing something that was just typed.

After refreshing Firefox, left click on a link opens it in same tab instead of separate tab. In options, Open links in tabs instead of new windows and When you open a link in a new tab, switch to it immediately are both checked. This is happening on my pc and laptop. I know I can centre wheel click or right click and open in new tab but why has behavior of years stopped working. I am fast losing faith in Firefox.

I always use my computer with sleep-mode, I rarely shut-down my computer. So I never terminate my Firefox sessions or close it completely. After waking up computer from sleep mode, You are expected to continue working from where you left off. So you continue to sync your bookmarks and so on. But Firefox Sync never synchronizes your bookmarks or data in the situation after waking up computer from sleep mode. It is a big problem. I think Firefox sync service can not handle or recognise the computer sleep-mode.

Youtube and Yahoo Finance specifically. I have not checked further. Yes I know Windows 7 is not supported by Microsoft, but Firefox has claimed that it would support Windows 7 indefinitely. Yesterday when I opened Firefox a message said that audio and video might not work if I did not have DRM enabled. I checked and saw that I had DRM enabled, but audio did not work. A button in the message said Enable DRM, I clicked the button anyway. No audio. I restarted Firefox, no audio. I restarted my computer, no audio. I opened Chrome and everything is working fine.  I did not even okay this update. I have my preferences set to NOT automatically update. it seems like Firefox is ignoring my preferences. Firefox should provide an instant downgrade to the previous version that supported audio. In the past I have downgraded a few times until things were working smoothly, but it's a headache. Now I understand Firefox makes it even harder to do that. I may just switch to Chrome permanently.

In earlier versions it would always open ""maximised"". So for me this behaviour changed (not sure exactly in which version it changed).
Since I use my browser almost always with maximised windows, I have to maximise manually all the time now, and that is inconvenient.
How can I get the old behaviour back?
Preferably I would be able to establish a size I like (maximised, or otherwise as big a size as I set), and then save those settings for the future.
Alternatively, I would also be happy if Firefox remembers the size of the window I closed latest.
Is there any way to accomplish this?

I have checked the incoming and outgoing settings and they are the same as they have been in the past. But to be safe I doubled checked with the IMAP settings provided by office 365 and they are correct. Tried to change it to POP to see if that would work..still no go.  I made sure IMAP and POP is enabled in office 365 and also that it is enabled under my administration for this email address.  Godaddy told me Thunderbird does not support IMAP and I had to use different client. I tried two other email clients just to be safe and I get the same problem. Godaddy basically tells me to go pound sand and use outlook or web based. I don't really want to pay godaddy $49.99 and switch to outlook for mail.  Anyone have any other ideas of what could be the problem ? Adding the screen shot of the settings from office 365.

Upon request by the POST method in the specified browser from the Apache server on the same computer loads a static web page with the following META tag in its header:
&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=""Set-Cookie"" CONTENT=""name=password; PATH=/""&gt;
After that, cookies must be created in the browser. Really they are created - in other browsers (Chrome and Opera), but for some reason they ceased to be created in the Firefox browser. What is the reason for this and is it possible to resume and track their creation in Firefox? I would be grateful for any answer on this question.

I bought a new Android phone a few days ago and it seems that when the new phone was activated, Thunderbird on my laptop quit working. The last mail received was May 17.   I use my Android phone to set up a hotspot to run my laptop, so they are actually connected somehow.  Various error messages, all seem related to the google server not recognizing my email or password.  Latest error is The STAT command did not succeed.  Error getting message number and sizes.  mail server <a href=""http://pop.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pop.gmail.com</a> responded: Username and password not accepted.   I've set Gmail to allow unsafe apps, that didn't work.  I've changed setting from Password to OAuth2, and it says it gave me a new password, but it still doesn't work.  I don't want to use IMAP, I only get mail on my laptop, and want all mail stored locally. I don't want to sync multiple devices.  I've removed my google account and re-added it to my phone, that did nothing.  I've made sure I'm signed out of all old accounts.  It appears to me that google suddenly decided to not allow access to their mail via 3rd party apps, because the built in email app on my phone gets similar messages relating to ""unsafe apps"".  It worked on the old phone, but not on the new phone.   I'm at a loss, and don't know what to try next.  Any help appreciated.

<hr> Start of quoted text ----
<p>Check out ""What’s New"" and ""Known Issues"" for this version of Thunderbird below. As always, you’re encouraged to tell us what you think, or file a bug in Bugzilla
</p><p>Thunderbird version 68.8.0 provides an automatic update from Thunderbird version 60. If you have installed Lightning, Thunderbird's calendar add-on, it will automatically be updated to match the new version of Thunderbird. Refer to this Calendar troubleshooting article in case of problems.
</p><p>System Requirements: • Window: Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 or later • Mac: Mac OS X 10.9 or later • Linux: GTK+ 3.4 or higher. Details here.
</p><p>Please refer to Release Notes for version 68.0 to see the list of improvements and fixed issues.
</p>
<hr> End of quoted text ---
<p>That text is a verbose way of conveying one thing that the 60 to 68 upgrade does. That information is of little use. For, I want the full change log of what is new with 68.8, i.e. the full change log for the particular version that I am upgrading too. (For, I had 68., er, something, before - the Thunderbird 'about' dialogue now shows the new version number, even though I have yet to restart Thunderbird.) In short: *if you are going to make the user read about changes, actually tell the reader what those changes are.* It is just *obvious* that that is what should happen (for one sees the text when clicking something called . . 'release notes') or at the least it is obvious that you should provide a link to a proper change log.
</p><p>Also, it is a little bit stupid for a 'tell us what you think' link to lead to a webpage soliciting a *question*.

I have a recurring problem with Thunderbird.  It is bad enough that it makes me wonder whether I ought to change to a different mail client.  In brief, I dread Thunderbird updates.  They cause a mess, the most visible part of which is that many, not all, of my E-mails, both old and new, are doubled.  That is, for hundreds of E-mails, instead of there being one of each, there are now two.  A.  How can I stop this in the future?  B. What can I do about it now, other than time-consumingly going through all my E-mails and getting rid of the doubles?  C. Why does this happen at all?  D.  As the mess that Thunderbird makes with its updates is predictable and has been so for years, does Mozilla care?

I think that considering data usage on mobile phones it's essential to make this improvement. More, using our phones anywhere can cause medias playback to be annoying for users and/or people around.

</p><p>I've tried searching for the answer to this problem for hours but everything's telling me how to make Firefox download things automatically but I want to stop it doing that.
</p><p>I've always had my 'phone (Samsung S9+) set to ask me every time how I want to open files when I tap on them. However, this afternoon, when I tapped on a pdf link and it popped up to ask if I wanted to download the document or simply view it (in Google Viewer, I think it was), download was already highlighted and I accidentally (and very stupidly) tapped 'Always'.
</p><p>Now, every time I tap on a pdf link in Firefox, my 'phone is automatically downloading the file, instead of offering me the option to simply view it without downloading it, which is what I want to do.
</p><p>I've tried deleting cache files, uninstalling and reinstalling Acrobat Reader (in case it forced something to give me options again) and if I was using the Windows version of Firefox, the solution appears to be no more than a couple of clicks away. However, that doesn't seem to be the case in Firefox on my Android 'phone!
</p><p>Please could someone help because I don't want to waste any more of my life searching for the solution to a single errant finger tap!

Says that it is unable to accept new master password even though this is the setup for this function. Gave up on that went back and looked at chrome for password and manually entered so that i could just click save when it asked. When i went to save log in information it said master password is required and still will not accept my entry even though it fills the bar for ""quality"". So no matter which route i go it is saying that changing master password has failed.

What's wrong with this web page?  How do I delete an undesired account?  How do I actually contact tech support instead of a general user forum?

I can see videos through websites like Zoom, Shaw Bluewave, youtube, etc etc. But for some reason on this one site I can't get videos to display to play. Yet when I go to Chrome it's there and fine. So it's an issue with Firefox. I'm not sure how to fix it at this point. 
</p><p>I've unchecked Use recommended performance settings.
I've switched the default theme
I've disabled extensions  (which fixed another issue of not displaying images)
I've refreshed Firefox
I've uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox
I've checked all my graphics drives (they're all there and working)

</p><p>I would like to address the following feedback to Designers, User Experience Experts, and Developers of Firefox.
</p><p>I am creating this post to mention something very important about the usuability of Firefox and that people look for in choosing their browsers. Although ""just"" usability aspects, I think they cannot be overlooked in order to make Firefox the go-to choice of more users.
</p><p>There are a four (relatilvely) small features that Firefox lacks in respect to Chrome and other major browsers, and a number of people miss them so much that end up using other browsers.  Namely:
</p><p>1) There is no ""Type Address + Tab"" functionality when typing a URL of a website in the address bar and then pressing Tab so as to directly type the search that a user wants to look for once landing on the given website (this is a famous Chrome feature).
</p><p>2) a CTRL + F search for a word in a web page does not highlight all words in a page, but only the current one is found (one needs to click enter to find the next one but it does not work like in Chrome or Safari which they highlight ALL instances of the searched text)
</p><p>3) a laptop trackpad's pinch in/out with two fingers does not allow the zoom of a web page (third party plug ins fail at doing this task properly).
</p><p>4) ALL other browsers open an incognito window with CTRL + SHIT + N. Why does Firefox does it differenly with CTRL + SHIT + P? This creates confusion for the average browser user.
</p><p><br>
I think having an attention to detail for such feature is <strong>really important</strong>. It would increase Firefox's userbase. Although a person choosing Firefox is making an important, usually conscious decision, about privacy, usuability plays an essential role for an average internet user.

my computersystem seems to have an error, which leads in certain cases to a bluescreen. During the last couple of months i had cases where a Firefox tab crashed and restoring the tab always led to a bluescreen. I don't think that my Firefox instance is the main problem, but knowing the cause of those crashes could help me finding a solution.
The last crash gave me the following crash reports:
bp-5c21003e-9e92-4251-836d-1f8840200521
bp-9a8fa9a0-282e-4980-808b-9bb1e0200521

bp-de80bdf5-a533-49a5-8e07-d23e70200521
</p><p>If you are couriose about the bluescreen messages: In most of the cases the error message was Memory_Management and Kernel_Data_Inpage_Error. Because of that i tested my RAM and my Harddrive. Both hadn't any errors which led me to a dead end. Investigating the Kernel error led to failiure code: 0x0000007a which should be a file access error. That tells me that those blue screens should be tied together. Even if you give me some informations about the cause of the firefox crash report i would be very thankfull.
</p><p>Sincerely Dave

</p><p>So in order to be sure if wiping them off the drive is safe, can someone explain the purpose of NSEML in TB?
</p><p>Might them be just copies created during transfer from GMAIL before adding them to th e inbox?

</p><p>Searching it online, it doesn't seem to be a common problem, and it just started happening by itself. I don't remember installing anything on this PC that day. My only antivirus is Windows Defender.  I don't use any VPNs.
</p><p>Tried all solutions I could find on Google. So far I did:
</p>
<ul><li> Ctrl + F5
</li><li> Edited the hosts file
</li><li> Deleted cert8.db
</li><li> Changed network proxy settings to No proxy and Automatically detect proxy configuration (was in Use system settings)
</li><li> Toggled DNS over HTTPS
</li><li> Went in about:config and toggled network.dns.disableIPv6
</li><li> Started Firefox in Safe Mode
</li><li> Backed up the profile folder and just let Firefox create a new one
</li><li> Rebooted my router
</li></ul>
<p>None of that worked.
</p><p>I work with site builder platforms and since yesterday the error is starting to creep up in those servers, too.
</p><p>Any ideas?
</p><p>EDIT: I just noticed that Wikipedia search is gone from the list of opensearch engines also… This is getting increasingly bizarre…

</p><p>I have had a lot of problems with Thunderbird lately.
I have tried a complete re-install, logging out and back in again, changing passwords and settings but it's not been working right for about two weeks.
</p><p>First of all, all of my emails wouldn't load when clicking on them, they only displayed the subject in the overview browser. I had my settings as 'downloaded for offline viewing' so I tried making my settings so they weren't available for offline which worked for a bit but some messages took far too long to load, appox 3-5 mins per message.  I then re-enabled for offline use and my mailboxes took about 5 days between 9am-6pm to download, each time only managing between 200-400 messages out of 21000 (I am working as a business) before I got a notification saying the server couldn't complete the task due to being under heavy load. Once this eventually completed, everything was fine for a few days but it started acting up again so I reverted back to online use only which again, worked fine for a few days and now most or if not all of my outgoing emails hang and struggle to send, most with the error - 
Sending of the message failed.
The message could not be sent because the connection to Outgoing server (SMTP) <a href=""http://smtp.ionos.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.ionos.co.uk</a> was lost in the middle of the transaction. Try again.
Or -
connection timed out
</p><p>I have also had issues with sending emails from my phone with attachments (pictures) where they just sit in the outbox not sending or doing anything, they don't have the red '!' like when there is an error which is puzzling and sometimes the emails show up days later.
</p><p>I have tried speaking with my email provider (Ionos) and they were very unhelpful, I checked all my settings and details with them and they advised that nothing is wrong on their end.
</p><p><br>
Can someone shed some light on this and help me as I am at my absolute wits end with this!
Any suggetions or help would be greatly appreciated, I have uploaded some of my thunderbird settings which may help. I really want to get this sorted as I enjoy using Thunderbird but at this rate, I am going to have to remove it completely and go back to Outlook.
</p><p>Thanks.

I have different mail accounts - one at GMX and one at google.
However - my main e-mail address is the GMX address and couldn't be changed to gmail so easyly.
But - as calendar I'll only use my gmail calendar.
If I get a invitation on my GMX account, the calendar entry will be stored also in GMX and I am not able to change the calendar, that's used. If I crate a own event, I am able to select the account to be used and I can change the account &amp; calendar for an existing event entry later on.
So - I'd like to define the gmail calendar to be used also for invitations that are coming via my GMX account - or to change the calendar later on exactly as it works for own created events.
Is there a solution to do that? If not, is it planned or can it be foreseen for the future?
Thanks in advance!
Uwe.

I just did fresh brand new initial Firefox install on both the most updated version of Windows 10 and the most recent version of Ubuntu 20.04. All addons appear in the toolbar except these 2.

Nothing will make them appear in the toolbar, yet they appear as enabled when they display under the addons &gt; extensions. Also, hitting the extension shortcuts will not bring up the addon interaction screen for any of the addons, e.g. Ctrl U or Ctrl &lt;period&gt; or whatever the relevant shortcut command is. This appears to only be an issue with FRESH Firefox install, because on my other computer running Windows 10 I've had the Multiaccount Containers Addon in the toolbar for 6 months without issue through many older versions of Firefox; and after I updated (rather than fresh install) to this latest version the Multiaccount Containers Addon remains in the toolbar without issue. 
</p><p>Can anyone suggest how I can get theMultiaccount Containers Addon and Temporary Containers Addon to appear in the toolbar?
And why are none of the extension shortcuts working - could I be executing them on the wrong screen? I've been trying them on the Addons &gt; Extensions screen.

Now I rescheduled some driveletter assignments to several folders on my NAS. When starting Thunderbird I discovered there was no more mail and I found out I needed to re-assign the mappings to the 'new' folder location of all my accounts. Never mind, after all it was just changing the driveletter, because I didn't change the path itself. 
It seems to work fine, but later I discovered all sub folders of my main account are gone. When I looked it up with the Explorer I could find only 3 subfolders (.sbd), but not the other ones. The 3 that were there weren't showing up in Thunderbird. 
</p>

After approximately 80 or so messages sent, I get the message that password is invalid and I enter the password several times, normally no joy.  I then close the program, wait for a couple of minutes, start the program and then after a couple of tries of entering the password, the mail merge continues.
Very frustrating, and not sure why this is happening - the password is always correct (I check with my gmail account and it works perfectly).  I use the mail merge frequently so this is a hassle.  Anyone have any ideas?

</p><p>Today my Windows 10 and Firefox browser have automatically updated themselves, which is totally fine, however, to my shock, when I started the browser, I found out that my default search engine was replaced by ""Yandex"", as well as ""eBay"" was added to the list of search engines, and I always had only Google (default), Bing and DuckDuckGo. I did not consent to this, nor I was warned that was going to happen. It's important to note that while I'm currently residing in Russia and therefore have a Russian IP address, all my programs, my OS and Firefox were set to use English as the default and only language, and I had everything pointing to United States as my only choice of region/location/language in the Windows regional settings. Also, further digging reveled that these were not the only settings that were reset. Among them were ALL privacy settings, toolbar &amp; UI customizations, and Pocket has raised from the dead, despite being completely switched off with about:config settings. And I am yet to discover how many other about:config settings were reset as well. The history, downloads and bookmarks all seem to be unaffected and in place and order.
</p><p>I know what the first reply is going to be: ""You've got a virus, bud"", but before anyone jumps to a conclusion that I've indeed got a virus/malware/whatever, absolutely the same thing has happened on my Linux install as well. No, it isn't a virus, at least on my end. It appears that Mozilla is the one engaging in such behavior. How else would you explain that both installs, one of which came from the official Mozilla's FTP, and the other one is from the official Arch repos, are both poisoned by this?! And guess what, I tried to replicate this in a virtual machine — absolutely the same result! All of the regional settings and the guest OS are set to English (United States), but I still get what I now call a ""regional inconvenience and overall experience downgrade pack"".
</p><p>I'd really like to hear an explanation as to why this happens and possibly have a responsible person's attention to the matter, or at least be able to file a bug report (if it is a bug, which I doubt it is — take a look at the paragraph above). But regardless of that I believe that such behavior on Mozilla's end is intolerable, infuriating and disrespectful to both users' settings and the users themselves, which is not how I remember Mozilla, when I started using Firefox (that was around when 1.5 came out).
</p><p>Now, a message to Mozilla:
If this continues, and if this is how Mozilla envisioned the future of Firefox, I'm afraid it's time for us to part ways and either use a fork that doesn't do this, or join the evil forces of IE6 2.0... whoops, I meant Chromium/Blink.
</p><p>You were indeed fighting for our freedoms back in the day, but apparently you are now fighting only for your monetary gains by pre-installing such regional inconvenience and overall experience downgrade packs. If I have an English (US) OS, but live in another country, I still want to have the same experience as English (US) users who are in the US. I don't need such ""convenience"". You need to understand something: nobody does! If they do have an urge to use a vanda...-""regionalized"" browser; they'd download an appropriate version and happily use it with their favorite search engine! Whereas me, and people like me can't, because you are forcing the same experience onto us. I've spent 15 years with Firefox and I wouldn't want to abandon using this amazing browser, but please, change your ways and consider your partnerships. Otherwise I want to do nothing with a browser that respects neither my settings, nor me.

How do I make the menu bar stay in view, permanently?  The Menu bar hides when cursor isn't at the top of the screen. When the cursor is at the top of the screen, it triggers the menu bar to unhide; resulting in it partially covering where I want to click or type. This popping in and out behaviour is annoying, distracting and I'm constantly finely repositioning my cursor to get functionality.  Disabling full screen mode isn't effective because then the web page isn't large enough to be viewed functionally.  I need the menu bar to be permanently in view while in full screen.

Today I power on my computer and for some reason my Firefox account was not configured on the browser. I just logged in with my Firefox account and wait until it finishes syncing all. After a few minutes it finished ""correctly"". 
I said ""Correctly"" because I was very surprised when I detect that all my saved passwords were not being sync. I tried with another computer that has the same Firefox account and it has all the passwords, but nothing appears on my computer.
I tried several things like restart computer, logout and login again, checked if key.db file exists on my home, etc but nothing works.
I just found one difference between the devices (both are Linux and bot are Fedora): On the device that I can see all the passwords Firefox version is 73. On the device that I described before that I cannot see any password Firefox version is 76. Can it be affecting the sync? I'm worried about to update Firefox on the devices that passwords are being displayed and lost it on both devices.
</p><p>My OS is Fedora 31 and my firefox version is 76.

I'm currently following a course on react developement and i'm running into an issue specifically on firefox, both normal and developer edition( normal version 76.0.1, dev version 77.0b7).
</p><p>I'm using axios to fetch weather data from weatherstack, which only offers http requests to free users, using the following line:
axios.get(`<a href=""http://api.weatherstack.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://api.weatherstack.com/</a>[...]')
</p><p>the first time during runtime, when i am fetching data, the request is using protocol http/1.1, which works fine. Any further requests start using http/2 however, which results in weatherstack sending back an error message saying ""Access Restricted - Your current Subscription Plan does not support HTTPS Encryption."" ( but with http status 200, which is kinda weird in itself). 
</p><p>looking into axios, (specifically how axios.get() works) it seems they are letting the browser decide on how to handle the request, so i came here. 
</p><p>This works fine on chrome(Version 83.0.4103.61), sending all requests via http/1.1 
</p><p>now my questions
am i correct in assuming this is a security feature doing this? 
if so, why is it not doing it on the first request?
how would i go about getting this to work or should i use a different api that accepts https if i want this to work on firefox?
</p><p>thanks in advance!
</p><p>edit: on further investigation, this behaviour is confined within a tab, so even if you reload the site, it still uses http/2. if you open the site in a new tab, the first request works and further requests do not.

I have tried searching for an add on that changes the folder icon colours, but the search brings up far to many bookmark add ons not related. I have tried many different searches but can't get a result.
Does anyone know of a mod/add on, or a way to change the Folder icons colour please?
Many thanks for reading.

File names get corrupted on download (but this doesn't happen in Safari, Edge or IE as far as i tested) so i thought i should ask here because i want my company to stay with FF as everything else works fine (Java web extensions for Oracle services, security, ease-of-use, translations etc....).
So, file named: 
</p><p>Uvoz_baza_v_ORAPACK_za_Ameriko_20.02.2020_-_RP0_Unior_kode.XLSX
</p><p>Gets downloaded as:
</p><p>%3D%3FUTF-8%3FB%3FVXZvel9iYXphX3ZfT1JBUEFDS196YV9BbWVyaWtvXzIwLjAyLjIwMjBfLV9SUDBfVW5pb3Jfa29kZS54bHN4%3F%3D
</p><p>... and of course Windows doesn't know what to do with it.. I can rename it, and give it proper extension then i can open it, so contents are not corrupted. If i download it multiple times, name stays the same but gives (1), then (2) then... at the end of the string.
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated as switching to another browser is not really an easy task here..
Thanks!

Im using Thunderbird on a mac and want to open Thunderbird with another program (called EPIKUR). Its a software for my psychotherapy office. I can chose to write an email via thunderbird by clicking on a patients email. Thunderbird starts a window for writing a new email but as soon as i want to send it, Thunderbird crashes. According to the Epikur software support the settings in epikur are all ok. Any ideas how to fix the problem?
Thanks

This just started out of the blue. I have verified my SMTP settings, changed my password, turned off my antivirus and firewall and tried to send, spent hours with the Geek Squad and a very nice lady at Spectrum, read many of the posts in this Support Group and tried some of the suggestions...all to no avail. 
</p><p>One good thing that I have been able to do is now I can at least receive e-mail; getting a good password (for Spectrum) and using it managed that for me. Before, I was not able to even get email.

That way I can differentiate them at a glance, plus I'd just like the option to customize them in general. I was searching for an answer to this, and a few people recommended an add-on/extension, however the posts were so old, the links were dead. I'm not sure if the add-ons still exist, but I figured I'd ask and see if anyone knew what they were. Most of the posts regarding this question seemed to be quite. That's why I thought I might ask again and see if anything has changed. If anyone has any ideas or suggestions I'd love to hear them. Even if it's an ""unofficial"" solution.

This set up has worked very well for my personal requirements now for about a year.  I can check both accts at one time and update my folders if necessary, all in one place.
</p><p>But now Google has apparently decided it is not happy with my use of Thunderbird.  No reason given.  Nothing communicated explicitly.  So first, a few days ago, it blocked my Gmail.  ""Authentication failure while connecting to server <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a>.""  Then Google demanded I “recover” my account, which Google must have taken down, ‘cause I sure didn’t.  Said this would take up to 5 days.
</p><p>I jumped thru all the Google hoops and did a recover.  I was told a “review” of my account could take 5 days.
</p><p>I just received notification from Google my account is recovered.  Enter NEW password.  
</p><p>Though I have NO IDEA why all this is happening, I did as asked.  New password.
</p><p>Back in Thunderbird now, whenever T-bird downloads a Gmail email a Google popup obscures a large area in the center of my screen telling me to sign in to Gmail with a convenient “NEXT” to make moving me over to Gmail client nice and easy.  Now every time I click on a Gmail email, I get this popup.
</p><p>Clearly, Google does NOT want me using T-bird, regardless of how well it works for ME.  If I got an explanation for this, it might help.  There might be what Google thinks is a justification all of a sudden to not want Gmail emails in T-bird.  But no reason/explanation has been given.  Just what feels like harassment.
</p><p>So right now it seems to me I am being pressured to do it Google’s way or get harassed with this string of tedious demands and impaired service until I do.
</p><p>I would love to know why this is happening and why Google seems so uptight about using T-bird client and if there is any way to get back to how I use T-bird and Gmail for the past year.

Since quite a while now I'm fighting against the phenomena that a bundle of shared ics-files, stored on a NAS in my local network are emptied from time to time. I'd been able restoring them from the automated backups in my profile folder, but sometimes it's a pain as the pretty new calendar got some data as well meanwhile and the merging needs some copy &amp; paste.  I'm sure that a couple of entries might have gone down the drain this way.
</p><p>It seems it has to do with Windows 10's habit not activating mounted drives before there are not opened manually in the Explorer. However, I think Lightning should rather display an error message instead of producing empty calendar files instead if it can't get immediate access.

</p><p>I'm currently working for a company where we need to distribute a set of exceptions for 4 internal websites. For many reasons the firefox currently does not trust the certificate that has been issued and users will receive the prompt ""Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead"" and the user can click on ""Advanced"" -&gt; ""Accept the risk and continue"" Now this is something we would like to prevent from happening.
</p><p>The obvious solution would be to have a proper certificate in place but that is the long term solution and we need a quick workaround with the same result -&gt; access the page without the prompt. The prompt is gone once we set the exception and copy the ""Cert_override.txt"" to the user profile. Now I have a script that I could use to copy the file to all profiles but that would be the absolute last thing I would want to do.
</p><p><strong> So my question is: is there any way to set an exception system wide instead of on a user profile basis?</strong> We are not using the Firefox ADMX templates but just a mozilla.cfg. Reading about the ADMX templates it also doesn't look like it would be possible via a policy, is that correct? Do you guys have any suggestions as to what we can do here? 
</p><p>Any helpful hints would be appreciated.

</p><p>However, few days ago, firefox started asking me (in a ribbon popup under the toolbar) something along the lines of ""Do you want to go to fb instead?""

I spent whole day searching on google and trying various accepted answers that suggest editing userChrome.css or toggling some settings in about:settings. None of these solutions work for me.

When I open Inspector from Firefox Developer Tools and select an HTML node, inspector shows numerous CSS related items for that node (like Rules, Layout, Computed, etc), but it does not show basic HTML DOM properties. In particular, I need to see innerText property for the currently selected node (and then walk through HTML tree watching innerText for every node).
I found that I can do Right Click, Show DOM properties and than it prints all properties to the Web Console window, but this is not convenient: I have to repeat this Right Click thing for every element and search for innerText every time. This will take forever.
So, question: is it possible to somehow show innerText for the current node automatically (like those CSS items are shown)?
Thank you

Meanwhile, all my bookmarks on Firefox are lost and have to start everything anew like a new customer each day. My membership email is the only thing that is retained therefore day-to-day. I've checked the settings and have even made Firefox my default browser but that hasn't helped. I should add that I also have Express VPN. When I add Firefox to the ExpressVPN's shortcuts, again it stays there only until I turn off the computer. Meanwhile, Google Chrome and my email icons remain on the VPN startup window and don't go away as does Firefox.

</p><p>unfortunately, Thunderbird forces the user two choices : seek update or automatically update. Everyday, Thunderbird annoys me with a pop-up telling me it could not update and that I should visit Thunderbird website to download a potentially new update. I do not want to do this every day. For a specific reason that I know, Thunderbird is prevented from checking for updates, but I do not want to change my general security config on my OS for just one app. So, my question is where is this little third button that states: “manually search for updates”. I understand it can be laughable given the wild wild web. Why someone would not want Thunderbird to search for automatically update after all? Because, sometimes, updates do break things, at least temporarily (e.g. remember Firefox and certificates) and I do not want to belong to the first batch of users to whom the update is going to be released. Also, there are users (maybe very slightly more advanced users, just a tiny more advanced, only slightly more like me) who do NOT want to be babysitted constantly and are able to take their own security without the constant reminders “please, do this, do that, your IP has changed, check your e-mail, please, enable 2-fa; etc.
</p><p>Even more complicated: where's the hidden settings under MacOS platform to disable once and for all this update search function. I went to Application Support folder, but found nothing)
</p><p>Thanks for your help,
Raf

</p><p>The reason I am looking in the toolbar of the library window is the Firefox documentation for version 76 on a mac corresponds to the Firefox version I have and the computer I am running it on states:
</p><p>From the toolbar on the Library window, click BUTTON ICON (PLEASE REFER TO ATTACHED SKETCH) Import and Backup and choose Export Bookmarks to HTML...
</p><p>I looked across the toolbar, then the entire Window marked ""Library"".  I wrote a program to search the Library window for an image that could conceivably be the button indicated in the documentation.  Sadly, the results of these efforts is I am here requesting assistance.  It is not that I do not love each and every one of you, but my preference is not to have to take the time for putting together a question to post here.  It does not take long, but  when we live at internet speed, every microsecond counts, I know you agree with this very important principle, particularly in light of the visit currently taking place where Covid and his entourage have all of us ridiculously locked up.  We have flattened the curve and also found out the numbers Fauci and Birx showed the President to justify this lockdown have been proven, not correct, more like wildly wrong.  So while we wait for the lockdown to be cancelled, my preference due to how my parents raised me is to be able to find the button described in the documentaiton, but NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, button not there... unless maybe you can see it  and I am missing it..  My hopes is you will refer to the image at this link in order to enhance the likelihood of success in my quest of the moment, i.e., making my quesiton understandable to anyone who might be interested or/and able to persist in pointing out the location of the great button of the bookmark export.

</p><p>If a website is dual-stacked, Firefox will first try to connect over IPv6 and fallback to IPv4 if it fails. However, Firefox never tries again to use IPv6 if it as fails once. Sometimes this leads to connection error if the connection is intermittent (so IPv6 will fails at the time of the request, but it’s not specific to IPv6, and Firefox will try over IPv4) and if IPv4 is broken at all (e.g. because IPv6 works so nobody notices it). So when the connection comes back, Firefox will be stuck to IPv4 and the site won’t display even if works with IPv6.
Even Ctrl-Shift-R doesn’t clear the connection cache.

</p><p>first: Firefox Preview for Android is a great product and I'm happily using it already (the most current version from Google Play, on Android 10).
</p><p>But every time I open a bookmark from my library or an ""important sites"" (in German: ""Wichtige Seiten"", e.g. the links you can pin to the tab overview page) a <strong>new tab</strong> gets opened. 
</p><p>Is there any way to <strong>reuse the current tab</strong> for bookmarks, similar to the behavior of almost all other browsers - and not least the default behavior of the previous ""classic"" version of Firefox for Android? The only way seems to be to manually enter the URL, which is... suboptimal.
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your replies.

I had copied all the files listed in the article.

This is not end-of-the-world stuff but I would like my lap-top to also show the folder as Deleted. Accessing the properties of the folder shows the name (Deleted or Trash) highlighted and one would imagine that you could type in a new name, but No, it doesn't work.
How can two installations of the same version have different properties?
On a side note, why have I just spent 20 minutes trying to find a place to post a Thunderbird message? Everything points to Firefox. It's almost as if Mozilla are deliberately trying to get rid of Thunderbird support. I've been going round in circles.

it was like i had just installed it. it was asking me all those questions. then it updated then closed again then opened asking me all those questions again then i signed in an all my passowords are gone again.
Lucky for me i saved a back-up a few months ago so i only lost a few passwords.
the spell checker doesn't work it keeps changing my set home page to Mozilla.
I go to a website while i'm there i get that same message safe mode or refresh.
now it doesn't give me that message it just refreshes its self without asking me and does it around every 20 minutes
so i stopped setting it back up. but tis still doing it. so i uninstalled firefox cleanerd all the leftover files and resistry keys rebooted then downloaded a new copy of the forefox installer. then installed i answered all the questions then set everything up and before i could go to a web site it refreshed its self How do I make it stop?
Its refreshed 2 times while i tried to type this so i had to write it in note pad then copy it then paste it here.

I'm not exactly sure what is happening and no one will help me. The biggest clue was out of nowhere my phone boots up as T-Mobile when I actually have an unlocked Verizon device. I also have phone numbers and info in my contacts that I can't explain and my contact info has been changed including a link to someone else's Gravitar profile in my user info. I'm missing calls, texts and voicemails. My settings keep changing to allow location and other sensitive permissions. I looked at my call history and it shows that I been calling my own number for exactly 27 seconds several times over the past week. My Samsung account and Google account show I have two devices with the same model numbers. I found a sent email to my other email account that dated back three years before I had the email it was sent from. I found an APN in my mobile network settings that looks questionable, it's set up with a username and password. 
Today I went into the Firefox browser using Duck Duck Go because there was a web address on the APN and my phone froze for no more than a minute and a website other than what I was looking for came up. I scrolled to the bottom to see who owned the site (WordPress associated with Gravitar) but there was a tiny little graphic on the bottom left corner that looked like a sound equilizer moving. It almost looked like it could have been coming from my internal system. So of course I clicked on it before thinking and was brought to a possible Chinese website I couldn't read a thing. Then I got off quicky after copying the address, made my Firefox security settings more rigid, closed everything out including my browsing history and closed the app completely. A few minutes later I got a notification that Firefox crashed and asked if I want to report it. I did. I guess I have a lot of questions. I don't know where to begin getting to the bottom of this. Google says it's Verizon's issue, Verizon says it's T-Mobiles problem and T-Mobile days contact Samsung. I think there may be more than one security issue I'm dealing with. I started using Signal as my text messaging default and I'm not known to frequent sketchy websites. I watch what I click on and check my Samsung, Google and Amazon security settings often. 
If someone could point me in the right direction that would be great. I don't know where to begin...

nothing I would do would correct this even completely removing Firefox, the profiles, and reinstalling it.
Reinstalling it is turning out to be my biggest mistake.
Instead of the version 63 installing, which is what my installer was for the installer is only installing the most recent buggy version
My version 63 had updates turned off, it should not have taken an update but it did even though the updates were turned off FOR security. I even had the registry set to block from HKLM
When I am 'browsing' the internet I am logged into my machine with a user account that can't even make any changes.
The current version (76.0.1) is having the same problems that plagued me before after this 'ninja update', the cache will not fully clear. When I open firefox it is showing it has items cached. There should be NOTHING in the cache when it opens, I do not have a home page set, there are no links set to open at startup and no connections should be made. The popup blocker is not only not blocking any popups it is opening them in new windows
The machine does not have a virus or malware.
Why is firefox so insecure now?
The whole idea of using firefox was to be using a secure browser and just a browser it is not supposed to be integrated into the operating system it is not supposed to be interacting with the operating system it is supposed to be an internet browser.
Without the ability to prevent this automatic communication and block unwanted traffic from it we may as well be using Internet Explorer, Edge or Chrome. 
How do we install one of the older more secure versions of Firefox without it automatically updating at the time of the install?
How do we actually block the automatic communication?
How do we block popups as the popup blocker does not work at all? (it worked beautifully in version 63)
How do we get it to clear the cache at exit and open with the cache at 0?

For a split second, as the email is being retrieved, I can see all (graphical) content, however less than a second later, it all disappears, and an empty box where the image/link used to be remains in its place. I have read about Thunderbirds ""protect your privacy"" and content security, but contrary to the instructions therein, there is no means for me to
1. Re-enable content (there is no blue preferences bar present at any time in the email application)
2. Such preferences anywhere in the settings that I can find.

Maybe another option to make Safari ‘send’ to Firefox (basically make it default) is sent out again, with slow regularity for new users an those who make my error. Or include the information ‘don’t do this’ so they don’t make the same mistake.
  What do I do, please?

Add the function to customise shortcuts is much easier than let Firefox recognise and deal with this situation, I think. In fact, most software supports customising shortcuts, so I'm surprised to find there's no way for Firefox to do that.

The same videos play fine in Chrome (which I hate to use - I'm a committed Firefox user!). I've also turned off tracking protections for YouTube - there's simply nothing left to disable! FWIW - only using Windows Defender as security, and there is nothing in it's log either.
I'd sure appreciate a solution if one exists!

Even <a href=""http://songsterr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">songsterr.com</a>.
I'm using latest Firefox 76.0.1 on a recent Ubuntu 20. 04 LTS installation. Usual troubleshooting like updates doesnt work because ""sudo apt-get upgrade"" doesn't find any updates.
I tried the same websites in the latest version of Chromium and they work perfectly fine. I couldn't find a mistake in the firefox settings or something so I'm confused.
Disabling Plugins didn't change anything and turning of tracking protection didn't either.
What is the Problem here and how can I solve it?

It is quiet alarming.
I've gone through the recommended fixes three times now but the problems persist. I've also reinstalled Adobe Flash Player and Duckduckgo as well as Firefox. I thought the problem could be flash because the freezing occurs most often when I am playing a word game. I tried taking a screen shot but the mouse is frozen while firefox is hung up. 
The jumbled pages can be anything but it seems that it's mostly pages with images. 
The problem occurs in safe mode, too.
I am not having similar issue with Safari.

A couple months ago my Firefox started to behave a little weird on opening new windows. At work I have to use our Ticket-System. When there is a Ticket I have to open it by double clicking. The window will open in a new window. This window always gets a weird position on my second screen and it looks like it would be zoomed, but it isn't. Here a Screenshot (left = MacBook, right = external 4K Monitor). I have a the same behavior when working in our CMS.
</p><p>What I did for troubleshooting:
</p>
<ol><li> Command + 0 to make sure it's really not zoomed (btw. if it would be zoomed there would be a % mark right to the URL).
</li><li> Close all windows and restart Firefox
</li></ol>

</li><li> finally I create a new clean profile and completely deleted the old one
</li></ol>
<p>None of the above changed the behavior. I have no clue what to do. Any ideas/help is appreciated. I can't stick to Firefox otherwise for now, it really stresses me out since I'm usually having lot of TABS+Windows opened.

</p><p>I was in TB this morning when my dog told me she wanted to go out.  When I came back after taking her for a walk, I saw that TB was closed.  TB has been crashing on an off for a couple of weeks.  So I restarted TB and continued my day.

</p><p>I checked the profile folder and the Inbox is there and the correct size (a couple of gig).  Nothing else seems to be missing.  Also, the other mail accounts are unaffected by this leading me to believe that the crash somehow affected the account that was open.

</p><p>Is there some kind of indexing or other ""view"" problem that is causing TB not to be able to ""see"" my Inbox?  I leave the emails on the server but over time, those emails age off and the only copy left is in TB.  If we can't fix this directly, do you think I could restore to April 30th, set all emails on the upstream server to Unread and then TB would get them as though they had never been downloaded?

In the Settings for Clearing History window, put a check mark next to Cache.
</p><p>I did this. I also have check marks next to Cookies, Active Logins, Site Preferences, and Offline Website Data. But I was still finding that when I looked at ""Cookies and Site Data: Your stored cookies, site data, and cache are currently using __ of disk space"" just after closing and reopening Firefox, the amount of disk space used would still be a significant amount, and so there were times when I needed to manually clear the data (we have been told by a cloud-based ERP we use, that clearing the data is recommended when their pages are not loading optimally).  But I should not have to be doing this manual clearing; it is supposed to be happening automatically when Firefox is closed and reopened.
I noticed that slightly below ""Cookies and Site Data: Your stored cookies, site data, and cache are currently using __ of disk space"" in the latest versions of Firefox there is now a check-box that says ""Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed."" For me it was unchecked. I was confused as to why I should have to check this box since it should already be covered in the Settings for Clearing History window, but I checked the box just to cover all my bases. I also clicked on the ""Manage Permissions"" button beside ""Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed,"" and made sure that there were not any exceptions populating it. There were not. 
But there are times when after closing and reopening Firefox, I will still find a significant amount of disk space being taken up in ""Cookies and Site Data: Your stored cookies, site data, and cache are currently using __ of disk space"" and the only way I can figure out to get it to clear is to clear it manually. What is causing this? How can I get it to all clear automatically when closing Firefox?

This is new, and did not occur in previous editions. Opening a blank tab does not interrupt the audio. If a tab is opened by a website (referral or by selecting a favorite) it may not interrupt the audio. Opening an eBay page always interrupts the audio (two short interruptions and then the audio continues.) This support page to enter a detailed question caused the audio to be interrupted. Opening one Gmail ID page from another Gmail ID page will interrupt the audio.

Now when I open Firefox I see the top menu if no other window is open. As soon as I open a window my screen looks like the 3rd image with no menu anymore, only Firefox. And no more bookmarks.

It seems like the browser has problems applying the correct colors to the elements, which most of the time results in poor contrast between background and text. I've noticed these problems on window titles, dialogs, tooltips and lists. Regarding the latter, the problem seems to be corrected as soon as the element is on focus, and reverts to the wrong colors when focus is lost.
</p><p>Interim solution to at least improve readability is to refresh FF while on light mode, and then switch the OS back to dark mode. After this, change FF to dark mode. End result is not ideal as FF's chrome becomes dark but affected elements remain light.

Let's say the site is lfoo.bar.baz (it's a subdomain, and the top-level is not a .com). When I open a new tab and type ""l"", Lfoo does not autofill; it is in the dropdown and I have to press the Down arrow to highlight it.
This is a big hitch in my workflow, because I expect Ctrl-T L Enter to get me to Lfoo like it did before FF75. 
</p><p>This is what I've already tried:
</p>
<ul><li> I tried config modifications to revert the bar to pre-75 behavior. When they didn't work, I reverted them.
</li><li> I removed all other bookmarks with sites that start with L, notably LinkedIn.
</li><li> I deleted all instances of LinkedIn (the site that was appearing instead of Lfoo) from my history. After this, instead of autofilling LinkedIn, which I barely use and hadn't visited in 90 days (places.frecency.fourthBucketCutoff), the location bar would not fill in anything after I typed ""l.""
</li><li> I gave my Lfoo bookmark the keyword ""l."" This worked, but it's a total hack and I shouldn't have to do it; also, it doesn't autofill lfoo.bar.baz into the location bar, but just moves the cursor down to Lfoo in the dropdown when I type ""l.""
</li><li> I ticked ""When using the address bar, suggest"" &gt; ""Browsing history."" This worked, but of course browsing history is now suggested for every other input (which I don't want-- it's why I had this turned off in the first place). I don't want Lfoo suggested on the basis of my history; I want it suggested because it's a bookmark and I asked Firefox to suggest bookmarks.
</li></ul>
<p>Because lfoo.bar.baz is a subdomain, not a .com, and a redirect to a login page, I suspect it has been discounted for suggestion in spite of it being one of my most-used sites and far and away my most used site that starts with L.

When I load the website <a href=""http://klotz-sentry.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://klotz-sentry.com/</a> for the first time, the video is started via the playback button of the video player (html5). The video will play normally as expected.
If I reload the site and click the play button, the video will also start, but the site jumps down quite a bit. The video is then no longer visible and you have to scroll up again. The jump goes from the orange frame to the red frame.
</p><p>This only happens in Firefox. All other browsers work as expected.
I use Firefox 76.0.1 (64-bit).
</p><p>I didn't set any anchors and it would still be surprising if the play button triggered a jump to an anchor.
</p><p>The HTML code is very simple.
</p><p>What can be the reason for this undesirable behavior?
</p><p>Best regards
Michael

After updating to FF 76 (or even 75) with new Adressbar I often have an issue with incorrect displaying of autocomplete selection.Tried to show on two screenshot: the first one is right after opening a new tab (or closing the last one), url bar autofocused, I've started typing my request (i.e. 'python' on screenshots). Urlbar automatically completing my input to the first shown suggestion, but doesn't separate my input from the added part - there isn't any selection or even cursor.
If I switch to another tab or alt-tab to some other window, then back to this input, it restore normal behavior (screenshot 2): manual input is normal text, suggestion is selected.
Can't reproduce the issue specially - it happens randomly but regularly. I'm using Firefox for many years with the same profile, didn't modify any settings recently - 99% sure issue came with one of last major updates with modified url bar.
Did anyone have the same issue and what can I try to repair it? Thanks for any possible answers, sorry for my english))

</p><p>When I load the same page in Chromium, I see no such messages in the console.
</p><p>Furthermore, there are no utils.js and gps.js scripts in the source of the loaded page.
Finally, I see no problems with the display or the functionality of the page.
Clearing all the cookies and the caches (local and server) has no impact on this issue.
There are many other javascripts on the page, both inline and not, which do not appear to be affected but the existing settings.
</p><p>So, my questions:
1) Why do these messages appear?
2) Is this an issue that I need to fix or can I safely ignore it?
3) what do the numbers after the script names mean? (gps.js:231:11 utils.js:35:9)

And in the same way they were out of order last time, stuff like ""Stuff 3"" being above ""Stuff 2"" instead of below it, etc. And ""Anime 2"" being way down the list, instead of right below ""Anime"".

</p><p>So far I was using Brave on all my devices, but recently I tried Firefox and I really like Firefox sync which encrypts e2e my bookmarks and visited websites between all my devices,
</p><p>There's one thing on Firefox desktop which doesn't work the same way as in Brave, on MacOS in Brave when I was zooming a page a clickable link on a page is in a different position than a link itself,
</p><p>I especially can see it when zoomed the actual clickable area of a link is above a text, then menu appears below the point I clicked it
</p><p>Comparing to Brave when zooming both areas are not synced when zooming
</p><p>So far I tried with support from here to set apz.allow_zooming to true, it helped with smoother zooming, but that issue described above came up

I am so tired of every update changing how Firefox Android handles video and audio file types ~ MIMEs.
I want a permanent setting to propting us , to ask us what I want to do when we click on a video or audio link. Maybe everyone else just wants to play it. But I don't and I'm sure I'm not alone. -_-
</p><p>It would be wonderful if Firefox Android would have the same answers as Firefox for desktop specifically:

</p><p>Maybe I'm not searching correctly but I spent hours searching for a solution before posting this question. Also for previous FFA versions this question is always being asked after every update! WHEN will we as a community stop disabling the ability to control what we do with audio and video links! -_-
</p><p>Please do not suggest a third-party plugin when this is an innate browser function!

I do have one addon for downloading videos, but I was trying to get a second one, and the browser will not let me, for some reason. Am I doing something wrong here, because I got the addons from the official Firefox addons site??

If this is not the right place, I'd appreciate a link to the correct one. 
</p><p>I'm new to Mac OS, have been a long time Windows-7 user, and long ago was a UNIX user at my then employer. But it's past time to say goodby to Redmond.
</p><p>I want to transfer my <s>Firefox</s> Thunderbird email history as well as my address book etc. from the Windows 7 installation of <s>Firefox</s> Thunderbird, (which says it's ""68.8.0 (32-bit)"", it was updated today, May 10) over to the new (to me) MacBook-Pro <s>Firefox</s> Thunderbird (version latest as of May 9, so far haven't figured out how to cause the Mac Thunderbird to show it's version info)
</p><p>While the instructions for copying the profile info on the Windows machine and transferring to another Windows machine are clear, and the instructions for copying an existing Mac profile and transferring to a new Mac are clear, I am unable to find any information on how to move the Windows files to the Mac installation. 
</p><p>I tried copying everything in the Windows ""Thunderbird"" directory to a flash drive, then tried replacing the Thunderbird files on the Mac with the copied files but that didn't work. 
</p><p>What is the procedure I should be following? For the moment I'll be keeping the Win-7 machine ""alive"" but would really like to abandon it soon.

The recent update (76), have broken my previous method of doing this.

</p><p>After the recent update, my browser fails to read the .cfg on startup and tells me that each time I open Firefox ('failed to read the configuration file'). For transparency, the code in that .cfg file looks like this:
</p><p>// Do not remove this comment

</p><p>var newTabURL = ""file:///path-to-my-page/index.html"";

</p><p>aboutNewTabService.newTabURL = newTabURL;
</p><p>Not sure how to put that in a code format on this forum. If anyone has any idea why the recent changes have broken this or a way to fix it, I'd appreciate it.
</p><p>Edit: I've figured out it fails on the last line, as commenting that out causes it to no longer fail to read the config file. Can you not set the newTabURL anymore? Has it been renamed to something else?

</p><p>On the new computer TB opens perfectly the first time. After that it does not open. A error window flashes by in the top computer but so quickly I can't read it. I filmed it with my phone and the error message is: 
</p><p>&lt;window &lt;="""" ^="""" id=""messengerWi"" p=""""&gt;&lt;/window&gt;</p><p>The error message is wider than the screen so truncates as above.
</p><p>TB only opens now in Safe Mode. I've removed Lightning and Google Provider and all Themes. TB still will not open except in Safe mode. 
</p><p>The main difference now between the two versions is that TB on the old computer is in Light Mode with the Calendar's installed. On the new computer it is in dark mode and the toolbar is different. 
</p><p>Opening in safe mode, selecting ""Disable all add-ons"" highlights the ""Make Changes and Restart"" button but it doesn't work. Selecting ""Reset Toolbars and Controls"" allows a restart but the same error message appears and TB doesn't start. 
</p><p>The old computer is a Dell Latitude E6510 with 8 GB RAM and the new computer is a Dell Precision 7510 with 16 GB of RAM.

I've been the victim of breaches.,"<p>I've had a hacker or whatever you would call someone who gets into my computer regularly. I have Malwarebytes Virus Protection and am going to get MWB Privacy. My debit card has been frozen x 15 days now without their sending me a new one.
What this thug does is go to my email account, sign in as me, and tell them he/I forgot the password. Then he can verify it, and then he does the same thing. For about four months, he came and went, and all he did was change all my passwords. No matter what kind of secure p/w I used, he could always change it.
On 04/26, I saw a charge on my debit card for $1.00 from FacebookPay or whatever, a verification charge. I immediately called FBPay and told them that was a fraudulent charge. I asked them to close the FBPay account. They did, but they also, without my permission, froze my card. I immediately reported that to the bank but they were busy merging with another bank, and they lie, so I still don't have access to my stimulus check or my last two paychecks. New bank is assuring me it's in the mail. 
Naturally, I want to know what to do when I get my new debit card so the thug won't see it. I figure I can either order things I need from Amazon and eBay and then delete the card, or I could call them and give them the card info. I've been told I need to have this computer wiped clean, but that would leave me with no means of communication or getting my money out, since they only let you get $500 a day.. How do I deal with this thug?
Thank you. I don't know much about computers. I'm considering taking it back to the store where I bought it and demanding one exactly like it or better but I don't know if that would go over or not. I can't pay rent, buy food, pay any bills, or do anything because the debit card people have all my money. I need to resolve the problem of my thug before I set up a new computer.
Thank you so much for reading this and trying to help me.

Now I cleared my cookies (which is when this error happened afterwards) and unplugged my modem for a few minutes (about 15) in order to get a new IP address (someone somewhere I read mentioned that might help). This didn't do anything, same error as before. I also went to about:preferences#privacy and clicked ""standard"" (for some reason it was at custom and had been blocking cookies, not sure why, I didn't do that). Then I went to cloudflare support, but you have to have an account to ask questions. I set one up with my email, but then you have to add your website. I HAVE NO WEBSITE! So I don't know what to do, and this has never happened before. This is not a problem on other devices, or on this computer with other browsers. I am using a windows 10 PC and have a dynamic IP address. Please help.

</p><p>While doing troubleshooting and trying to find ways of making the lag minimise or stop altogether, I upgraded the wireless receiver's drivers and restarted the system. All started out well as it rebooted, I had Pingplotter up and testing a ping to Google, was looking good as the ping stayed mostly in the green (I'm in Australia, high ping is a thing here). So I booted up Firefox, and the ping started going back to the way it was before I rebooted the system, ie. a high ping spike (in the red) every 5 seconds. There's a definite pattern to it as well, as I have saved graphs showing what's going on.
</p><p>I'm using Chrome for the time being, but I've been using Firefox for years prior and very minimal hiccups to speak of, until now. This is a BIG hiccup for me, as I use my PC for gaming online, and this ping spike every 5 seconds is unacceptable.

Any time I start a new browser session, I have to go into my privacy settings and manually check the ""ask to save logins"" option and then refresh so that the change is active. I don't know why but if this option remains unchecked, then my logins will not autofill despite this option being checked off. I'm not sure how to fix this or why it even started.

A few days ago my primary computer smoked itself, so today I've spent most of my Saturday laboriously recreating my e-mail accounts on the new computer I just bought.  It would have been all but impossible if I hadn't taken the precaution of making screenshots of each one's account settings a few months ago when it began giving me trouble.
</p><p>My question is, why isn't there any easy way to import the address books and filters?  I don't want to transfer my files from Becky, whatever that is, or Outlook, and I haven't been able to find any text files or vcf files for the  address books...so am I doomed to recreate all these thousands of entries again by hand?  That's just ridiculous when every other mail program out there offers a quick and easy method of transferring their settings from one computer to another...even if they happen to be stored on an external drive rather than an internal one.

After downloading  files from different websites, ex.  .csv or .pdf, etc., the Downloads Panel asks whether to Save or Open.    If I select Save it saves to ~/Downloads  but then if I click on the folder or right-click to view the folder contents Firefox now brings up a dialog titled ""Launch Application"" and has a choose button to search for other Application.  I'm not sure why Firefox is asking me to select a new launch application when it should be able to determine that for basic file types that should already be registered in the OS like PDF and CSV.    If I select ""choose"" and try to find a preinstalled app from  /usr/bin    it says Permission Denied.

My PC has all my bookmarks, and I have it empty on android. On my first try after signing in on both devices and turning on sync, I did get a ""mobile bookmarks"" folder (with the few default bookmarks) on PC, but my many PC bookmarks did not appear on firefox for android. For now I've disconnected both, after also unchecking bookmarks from the sync in both etc. But I still want to get my bookmarks onto my phone from my PC, and I've read sync is how you do that. And this attempt did not sync any bookmarks onto android.
</p><p>Edit: tried again the next day, signed in on PC first and then on android, with only bookmarks checked under sync options on both devices. This time it did work, and my PC bookmarks are all on android under ""Desktop bookmarks"". So that's cool.
</p><p>Since my first try yesterday I had deleted my few default android bookmarks so that that one was empty. And I backed up and restored my PC bookmarks and tried a couple things. So this time around I don't currently have any ""mobile bookmarks"" folder on PC. I've added a couple bookmarks and subfolders on the mobile bookmarks on Android, hasn't popped up on PC yet.
</p><p>Also a minor note, for some reason the ""bookmarks menu"" part was minimized after I first tried syncing, so for a bit I thought my bookmarks just weren't showing in the ""all bookmarks"" menu. So that wasn't an issue.
</p><p>Anyways, still figuring out a couple things on the android side, folders etc. How they work differently than on PC. On PC you can have folders mixed in with bookmarks, but on android all subfolders appear at the top of a folder, instead of interspersed the way I placed them on PC. So that can mess with organization for me. And stuff like that. But mostly it's sorted out.

Do note that my second question has NOT received A SINGLE REPLY from anybody. I have now updated to version 72 and then subsequently to version 76.0.1 (which the latest one at the time of writing this question. I am still suffering from the same problem of stuttering 1080p 60fps YouTube videos due to frame drops, <strong>especially using the VP9 codec</strong>, although other codecs also drop a few frames. Do note that the audio works just fine in real-time without any lag, and this problem exists ONLY for 1080p @ 60 fps, not for any other resolution or frame rate. I have referred to the following links to try and solve my problem:-

<p>The Firefox version 72.0.2 release notes categorically state that the issue has been resolved and even points to the bugzilla page for the same. But it still exists even in version 76.0.1, which is surprising. I have tried every possible combination I can think of, from setting <em>media.media-capabilities.enabled</em> = <strong>false</strong> in <strong>about:config</strong> to disabling specific codecs and hardware acceleration, none of which solved the issue permanently to my satisfaction. A few settings, at times, improved the issue slightly but there was no permanent solution, even though this has been alluded to in a previous release note. Do note that my graphics drivers are updated and this issue is Firefox-specific, i.e other browsers work just fine. Even the older versions of Firefox work fine, as stated earlier. I would like to state that I prefer using the VP9 codec because other codecs take a toll on my relatively low-bandwidth network connection and this leads to longer buffering times (VP9 does not have this problem). I humbly request the community members and volunteers to help me in this regard, <strong>and if need be, point me to the proper channel for lodging a bug report directly to Mozilla</strong>. 
</p><p>Thanks and regards,<br>
Preetodeep Dev.
</p><p><em>P.S:-</em> If this issue is not resolved, then I will have<strong> no choice but to go back to Firefox version 62.0.2</strong>, which works just fine with all the default settings.

A browser dialog is presented and asks for my PIN, but closes without error, yet the PIN is not accepted and the site (correctly) refuses access.  In my troubleshooting, I found that if I look at the Security Devices tab under Privacy&amp;Security, the PKCS#11 module shows the CAC as not logged in.  If I attempt to log in at that page, I get the usual PIN dialog, but after submission, a new message box appears with the notice that ""Log in failed"", and I can see that module still says Log out.  
</p><p>It appears that some file lock or related mechanism is in effect and needs to be reset.  The only solution I have been able to use is close Firefox completely (all windows), and restart.  This works but not desired as I have several different sites I'm active on, and each requires separate logins.
</p><p>Any suggestions for further troubleshooting would be appreciated.  My forays into Google searches all end up as help to get CAC card working, which is not my problem.  The card works until Firefox (or something related in the middleware) freezes and the only recourse is to restart.
</p><p>Cheers,
--Jim

It used to get cleared if the user clicked off the folder they were searching to another one, which was a simple way to clear it when finished.  Now the search is persistent and has to be cleared with the tiny X on the right of the bar.  Personally I find that this is such a nuisance that I'm finding myself trying to avoid using the Quick Filter Bar because it's too fiddly to clear.
Please can you re-instate the old system that cleared the Quick Filter Bar when the folder focus is changed, or provide this an option, or some other really quick keystroke to clear the Quick Filter Bar which is less fiddly than hitting that tiny X.

</p><p>Thunderbird: 68.7 
OS: Ubuntu 18.04
</p><p>Issue: Composer Text Formatting Not Remembering Format
</p><p>When composing emails the default format is ""Paragraph"" which automatically places white space after a block of text when a line feed is entered. If I want to have the text without white space I would reformat the text to ""Body Text"". If I have more than one block of ""Block Text"", say three lines of text, one after another, and I want a blank line after the Block Text, I enter a linefeed to push a line down. What happens is the Block Text formatting is forgotten and it returns to Paragraph formatting, adding white space where it wasn't intended. 
</p><p>I have also seen that the size of the text is forgotten, reformatting it to another font size. 
</p><p>Previous versions of TB used to default to Block Text where the user is able to control email formatting and line spacing. This is the correct default composing emails and text formatting.

I was poking around a website that I spotted opening additional browser windows behind my current one. These windows were advertising and the browser windows had most of the toolbars removed. My usual reaction to this is to immediately update my Hosts file with all of the URL's involved in the chain of events that opened up this unwanted window. However, after I did this, they still managed to open up despite being listed in my Hosts file to block! Here's what I noticed:
</p><p>Blocked URL's listed in my Hosts file remain blocked when attempting to open in my main browser window. But these sneaky windows opened up behind this window had the blue / purple badge displayed. I learned that these ""pop down"" windows were resembling an incognito session as it did not contain my Firefox account info, or much of anything else. I believe that the use of the Privacy Protection feature is what allowed these advertising windows to open up despite being listed on my Hosts file -because the session is so well protected, that even Windows can't see what's going on in there!
</p><p>I have to admit, I am actually impressed with the creativity of this trick. But to me this looks like in all simple terms to be an instance of taking a new feature and turning it around and using it against us to ploy their wares. It is advertising now, but I can see this easily progressing into malware if it hasn't already. I can provide addresses of the site I am experiencing this condition but be aware, it contains adult content!

Firefox storing > 700 passwords despite deletion,"<p>I'm migrating from firefox lockwise to lastpass because firefox does not offer true end to end encryption. That's fine, thanks for the great product, it's not my specific niche need however. When I use the FF password exporter tool it shows me that firefox actually saved 700 passwords and never deleted for the past few years. I'm not going to change all of those passwords and I want them gone from my computer out of cleartext. When I try to trick firefox to encrypt them by using a master password, they're still there and the FF password exporter still exports all. 
</p><p>about:logins is utterly empty. Before I resetted that by using the on this forum suggested method, I had 100 logins in about:logins. Seems like firefox only does soft deletes. So.... that's ghost data with passwords in cleartext that the user cannot control and most probably dont know. Ooooooppppsss!!!
</p><p>As you might understand, these security breaches are indeed one of the reasons I migrate.

1. Is this a common problem?
2. I do not want to have to do this when I am on my home base computer. Do I have to use another pw to see my saved pw's. How can that be done?
3. After changing my FF pw, why doesn't that work?

</p><p>When I'm watching any sort of media stream in Firefox, Youtube for example, I'll adjust the volume of the stream using the ""Firefox: Audio Stream"" slider that shows up in pavucontrol's playback section. This works fine. My problem however,  is that when I scroll back and forth in the video, refresh the page, or move to another video in the playlist, the slider in pavucontrol immediately jumps back up to 100%, ignoring the value I had just previously set. I want to know how to make the change I made in pavucontrol <em>persist</em>.
</p><p>This can be mitigated by using the in browser volume controls (the youtube volume slider), but these are usually quite small and don't offer as much control as the pavucontrol sliders do. Something else to note is that if I go into Firefox's about:config and set media.volume_scale to a value greater than 1, the pavucontrol sliders begin to act how I would like them to (not resetting to 100%). However, upon doing this audio streams now start at 0% volume, and the in-browser ""mute"" button is broken (sets the volume to 0, but won't change it back).
</p><p>Is there any way to achieve this behavior in Firefox? Literally every other browser I've tried just doesn't mess with my audio settings, so it's quite frustrating. This problem has persisted for years.

My email address is on my own domain and I've checked the SPF and DKIM records which are perfectly fine.
The emails are sent without problems to other domains. Its only Outlook that has a problem receiving from Thunderbird.
While sending the same email with the same TO and FROM address via the webmail interface, Outlook has no problem receiving.
</p><p>I've checked the Troubleshooting guide on [<a href=""https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/pm/troubleshooting.aspx|https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/pm/troubleshooting.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sendersupport.olc.protection..../troubleshooting.aspx</a>] and its of not much help. 
</p><p>I even tried comparing the recieved emails' source with the one that gets delivered WebMail-&gt;Outlook+GMAIL and the same email sent from Thunderbird-&gt;Outlook+GMAIL. 
</p><p>The only noticeable difference in the source is that the HELO=value is different.
Thunderbird sends my Computer's local IP address as the value.
</p><p>I've tried changing that too hoping to see it work, since the Outlook Troubleshooting guide mentions :- 
</p><p>""We may not accept email from senders who fail a reverse-DNS lookup. In some cases legitimate senders advertise themselves incorrectly as a non-internet routable IP when attempting to open a connection to <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a>""
</p><p>But this too did not work.
Usually If an email is blocked by Outlook and I enable DSN, It would alert me to the reason.
In this case I don't receive any notifications.
</p><p>Since its just specific case of Thunderbird-&gt;Outlook address that is not delivered due to filtering by Microsoft. 
Can anyone point me in the right direction? Why are only emails sent from Thunderbird being blocked ?

This is a Linux system and i'm using a tool called Recoll for the indexing.  i'm not only trying to save a little space but, now that i remember, i'm trying to get fewer repeated results when i try to use the file finder.  If this doesn't make sense, please ask for clarification.

I use windows 10 and my connection is 40 - 50 Mbps so email should not be all that slow. A 10 MB attachment to an email will take 10 - 15 sec to send to the recipient and then 150 sec or more to re-send itself to the Sent folder.

</p><p>Starting in Firefox version 76, Firefox will also check to see if you’ve reused 
any of these potentially vulnerable passwords with other logins you’ve saved

your breached passwords, then checking it against all saved passwords.
Firefox does not keep logs of your plaintext passwords or know them.

For example <a href=""http://youtube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">youtube.com</a> or <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">finance.yahoo.com</a> were really slow at loading compared to Firefox 72. CPU usage on one of my cores goes very high.
</p><p>This page for example would load the main screen fairly quick then it would stall while it loads all the stock widgets on the page which it doesn't do with Firefox 72 :
</p><p><a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPLK"" rel=""nofollow"">https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPLK</a>

</p><p>In all cases Firefox 72 and Chrome work fast and snappy.
Tried Firefox 73 and Firefox 76+ and they run awful.
</p><p>When I first noticed the issue back when Firefox73 was released, I gave up and rolled back to a Firefox 72 backup and thought it was probably a bug that would be sorted later. Tried again today with Firefox 76 and I still have the same issue so I have had to roll back to Firefox 72 again.
</p><p>Things I have tried that have NOT helped :
</p><p>Disabled all addons/extensions
Set Default Theme
Disabled DNS over HTTPS
Cleared cache/cookies
Deleted content-prefs.sqlite
Disabled hardware acceleration
Tried different values for content process limit
Disabled smooth scrolling

This link leads to the full article on the publisher's website.
My problem is: This link is NOT DISPLAYED anymore in firefox in all news of this kind
on this website.
But is was normally displayed in older versions of firefox.

any changes!!!
</p><p>I just update firefox each time a new release comes up and I always keep all settings
as they were before.
In other browsers (IE for example) it is ALSO still displayed!!!
So my idea is that a setting in firefox prevents those links from being displayed(?)
Is that possible and if yes: Which settings do affect the displaying of web-links?

The production servers have IIS 7 with persistent authentication disabled (Persist-Auth: false), which means that the browser should re-authenticate on every request.
For a POST request (full PostBack) with a large enough body, Firefox does not resend the request body anymore as of Firefox 76 (worked with previous versions). I have verified this in Fiddler. Other browsers do not have this issue.
This breaks the website because the ViewState is not being sent.

<p>Incorrect behaviour in Firefox 76:
</p>
<ol><li> Browser sends the request (without authorization header)
</li><li> Server responds with 401
</li><li> Browser resends the request with an empty body, with authorization header
</li><li> Server waits for the body but does not receive it, and the request gets cancelled after 2 minutes. Eventually, the browser displays a 401 Not Authorized error, but with Fiddler running I can see a 408 error with the text: ""The request body did not contain the specified number of bytes. Got 0, expected xxx.""
</li></ol>
<p>Just for fun, this is the non-compliant behavior in IE11 that actually works, unlike Firefox:

</p><p>I'm using Thunderbird 68.7.0 (current version) on an up-to-date Arch Linux installation. I have a multitude of different IMAP accounts from different providers set up. A couple of days ago, I started receiving ""Unable to open the summary file for Inbox. Perhaps there was an error on disk, or the full path is too long."" error popups for four of my accounts; only two accounts still operate normally. I can still access all emails using the respective webmailers, K9 on my phone or even Thunderbird on different machines, but not within this installation.
</p><p>I know there are plenty of threads about this error message all over the internet, but no solution I have seen so far has worked for me. Here's what I tried:
</p>
<ul><li> Compacting the inbox folder for affected accounts
</li><li> Right click on account -&gt; Properties -&gt; Repair
</li><li> Deleting all *.msf files in ImapMail for affected accounts
</li><li> Deleting the INBOX file in ImapMail for affected accounts
</li><li> Deleting the entire ImapMail folder
</li><li> Deleting global-messages-db.sqlite
</li><li> Starting Thunderbird in safe mode
</li><li> Making sure Thunderbird has both read and write permissions for all files and folders in ~/.thunderbird
</li></ul>
<p>None of these things helped. The error popup keeps showing up and I cannot see any messages on the affected accounts, but the folder structures are still there, even after doing any of these steps. I haven't tried wiping everything and reconfiguring Thunderbird from scratch, but obviously I'd like to avoid that.
</p><p>I don't think it has to do with too many mails or folders in the accounts because the account that holds by far the most messages and folders is among the two that still work. Also, the issue started arising at the same time for all affected accounts.
</p><p>Here's my terminal output after starting Thunderbird and clicking OK on all popups (why are there no proper formatting options for this here?):
</p><p>console.log: WebExtensions: Loading packed extension from /home/leon/.thunderbird/dra1pn8t.default/extensions/{e2fda1a4-762b-4020-b5ad-a41df1933103}.xpi

</p><p>I organise a lot of bookmarks through hierarchy folders. Within these folders there are several sub-folders with the same name, e.g. there are main folders named after the main theme and beyond that (sometimes also 2 or 3 levels beyond) there are folders named after a country. 
</p><p>Folder Theme A
</p>
<ul><li>  Folder Country A
</li><li>  Folder Country B
</li></ul>
<p>Folder Theme B
</p>
<ul><li> Bulleted list item Folder Theme B part 1
</li></ul>
<pre>  + Folder Country A
  + Folder Country B
</pre>
<ul><li> Bulleted list item Folder Theme B part 2
</li></ul>
<pre>  + Folder Country A
  + Folder Country B
</pre>
<p>....
</p><p>I have remarked now several times that the bookmarks of the Countries are moved or gathered in different folders. First I thought I moved a folder by accident, but it happened now serveral times and today it was clearly not made by me. Today Firefox now gathered the content of several Folder Country A of different Theme-Folders together in one. But it gathered only the content, the folder itself were moved to complete different Theme Folder where I found 3 sub folders now of Country A (but empty as the content was gathered.
</p><p>To make it better understandable:
</p><p>Folder Theme A
</p>
<ul><li>  Folder Country A
</li><li>  Folder Country A (from Theme B) - empty
</li><li>  Folder Country A (from Theme C) - empty
</li><li>  Folder Country A (from Theme D) - empty
</li></ul>
<p>Folder Theme B
</p>
<ul><li>  Folder Country A (contained the content of the Folder Country A folder of Theme A, B, C and D)
</li></ul>
<p>But this is only one example, I had also once found only one further subfolder in a complete different folder. I don't see a concrete process how these issue is occurring.
</p><p>Obviously there is a mix-up due to the same name of the folders, there ar eno bookmarks missing. But to rename the folders is not really a solution for me, especially as these folders are not duplicate in the same level of folders. I am not sure but I am assuming that these mix-ups has something to do with the sync function I activated in Firefox now a while ago. There are currently 3 devices which are synchronised over my Firefox account (1 Win10 laptop, 1 Android mobile and 1 Android mobile). But I have nothing changed with my mobile e.g., I just add sometimes bookmarks over the mobile devices. The ""wrong"" placements are also visible in the bookmark manager in Firefox on my mobile devices, so it is not only an issue with some settings as the bookmarks were really changed also over sync. 
</p><p>What can I do or is this a bug with the sync function?

I had never saved explicitly my bookmarks so I do not have any html or other kinds of backup files.
From the TimeMachine backup I have, I would like to get out my previous Firefox profile and put it in the right place on the new Mac.
I found these instructions, that seem exactly what I need:
""You can also copy Firefox’s bookmarks from its profile folder, if you cannot open Firefox on the old Mac or just have access to backups. Navigate to the “Library/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/” or “Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles” folders inside your user folder. You will find a folder named “Bookmarkbackups” inside a profile folder with a random name. Copy the most recent “.json” file from the folder to your external hard drive and use the “Restore” option in the Import and Backup menu to import it on the other Mac.""
But, unfortunately, both in my new Mac and in the TimeMachine backup the mentioned pathnames are missing.
Under the ""Library-Mozilla"" folder there is only a file named global.regs.
Under the ""Library-Application Support"" there isn't any ""Firefox"" folder, only a ""Mozilla"" folder containing another folder named ""Extensions"" (having 3 subfolders, all of them apparently empty)
Someone can help me to find and replace my profile? Thank you!

Before making the change, I backed up my entire Thunderbird profile (all 4 addresses) to make sure I didn't lose anything. I'm glad I did because once the server update was done on the GoDaddy side, the most recent emails showing through the webmail portal were two years old.

I can see all four of the separate email address folders in my Thunderbird backup location, but when I copy the contents of the email address I want to restore into the current Thunderbird folder, those folders only appear momentarily when I open Thunderbird before the synchronization with the server wipes them out. Is there a way to import them from the backup location while Thunderbird is open so the get synchronized up to the server?

Is it possible to change this background colour preferably using the userChrome.css file or alternatively an add-on? I know how to edit the userChrome file, so would like the code if possible please.

</p><p>Since AmEx redesigned their website several (many?) months ago, I've had increasing issues using Firefox to log-on the site via their (bookmarked) new log-in page (a bookmarked link to their old log-on page still works, as do all my other banking/financial sites, as well as 98% of other sites).   Log-on button reacts when clicked, but no action - doesn't seem to run its script.   Initially, allowing permissions multiple cycles using NoScript (as is typical for some sites, as scripts load) was sufficient (I try to reduce scripts to minimum necessary, always excluding Facebook scripts).   Logging on via link from AmEx home page sometimes worked slightly better.   However, internal site functions seemed to need multiple refreshes on load.   Within the last two months, only completely disabling NoScript for AmEx tab worked.  Today, not even disabling or uninstalling NoScript completely worked.   In addition, today cannot log-out of AmEx site without multiple (~10x) clicks on the log-out button (webpage seems to gradually close down functionality with each click and twirl of the script indicator, similar to functionality loading issue previously noted).
</p><p>Clearing all cache and cookies (per FF forum help) works one time - log-on can be accomplished with two attempts, but log-out continues problematic.  Subsequent log-ons problematic.
</p><p>As before, problem repeated on other computers (today, two other computers using Win10/FF76; one with a new Win10 and FF install w/o NS).
</p><p>Previously, other browsers unaffected (Old MS Edge, Opera).   Today, using MS Chrome Edge, AmEx site worked without problem.  However, noted that AmEx log-on page loaded with Edge was old-style (that still works with FF, also), not new.   All SSL certs (FF and Edge) verified.
</p><p>AmEx doesn't have any link to their Web Support - I guess I have to write them a letter..  Suspect it's a problem on their end, not FF, but have run into several sites lately where FF either doesn't run well, or is specifically not supported.   Don't want to give up privacy features and independence of FF, but would like some ammo to hit AmEx with, if it's indeed an engineered problem with their site.

</p><p>It <em>seems</em> to me that Tab Mix Plus was a very popular extension, not just one of my favorites. Because of this, i would think that if the structure of FireFox would allow, someone would probably by now have created a compatible version. This leads me to think there must be some aspects that can be handled by an extension, and some that can not due to internal coding.
</p><p>I can't understand why the FireFox development team wouldn't work with the community to provide those Tab Mix Plus enhancements to the internal coding that no longer can be created by an extension. It would seem like the competitive thing to do, so i must believe that there either is a real security reason, or simply the old extension was not as popular as i think it was.
</p><p>I'm afraid i must admit that it has been so long that there are probably many alternative replacements to the Tab Mix Plus features that i don't recall, yet i really did prefer a setting to open links in a new tab rather than having to hold down Ctrl at the same time of clicking - i know it seems picayune, but it still is a preference!
</p><p>I only mess around with VBA, so please use the ""big print and pictures"" method of explanation :)

The spam page loaded. From this I understand whatever is causing the problem is in my Firefox Account data.
</p><p>I then immediately logged out of Firefox on the second computer, uninstalled it and then redownloaded it. Without logging in, the spam still comes up. I am lost. Neither McAfee, Malwarebytes or AdwCleaner find it.

</p><p>Long-time Firefox user here. I'm running Firefox (version 75.0, auto-updates enabled) on a Windows 10  (Version 10.0.18362 Build 18362) desktop PC. I'm using the built-in Firefox password manager, although as a general practice I do not log into it using my master password unless absolutely needed (for example, to check my email or Slack). For the vast majority of the general browsing I do, I stay logged out of my accounts.
</p><p>This has worked just fine for years. However, lately Firefox keeps prompting me to enter my master password, and won't stop prompting me for my password while I'm browsing. Oftentimes I'll randomly receive the prompt, often on sites that should not be asking for a password, such as a blank New Tab or sites that don't have any associated data in my password manager.
</p><p>What's frustrating is that, when I close the prompt, Firefox will immediately re-prompt me again to enter my master password, despite me not wanting to log in (or on some sites, not having an account or even a login page). It will keep repeating this prompt incessantly, sometimes for 5-6 times before going away briefly, only to reoccur when I navigate to a new site. 
</p><p>My browser is configured to be a bit more privacy-conscious, and I'm wondering if this may be causing this behavior. In Options &gt; Privacy and Security, I've set Custom blocking for the following items:
- Cookies (all third-party sites)
- Tracking content (in all windows)
- Cryptominers
- Fingerprinters
I have also set my browser to delete cookies and site data upon closure. 
</p><p>I am using the following plugins, with auto-updates enabled:
uBlock Origin
HTTPS Everywhere
Privacy Badger
Decentraleyes
Cookie Autodelete
Firefox Mult-Account Containers
Facebook Container
</p><p>I've searched the support forums for help on this topic and found the two articles below. However, after trying the offered solutions, neither fixed the underlying behavior. Also note that I am not using any third-party antivirus solutions, like ESET Internet Security and Avast, which have been known to cause similar issues with the Firefox password manager. Here are the articles I found:
<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-keeps-asking-me-master-password"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-keeps-asking-me-master-password</a> (I tried these steps and still had the same behavior happen)
<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1176785"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1176785</a> (this just disables the Password Manager, something I ideally would not have to do to stop this behavior)

Same also happens if I go to Options - Downloads - and try to change settings.
In other words, Firefox now ceases to respond anytime it addresses my HDD file system.
Downloads history cleared - no effect.
Restart with add-ons disabled - no effect.
Any attempt to change ""where to save files"" - it freezes. At the moment it freezes it looks like some empty window with blue edges tries to open just in a flash and immediately disappears. After that the only help is Task Manager - end task - restart.
Other browsers keep working, no problem with any upload or download.

I have Firefox 75.0 (64 bit) and I am facing a very annoying issue that is especially irritating now during coronavirus day, when I have to work a lot with video chats et cetera.
</p><p>So I have noticed that Firefox is having problems with sending audio on bluetooth headphones. The headphones are Sony WH-CH500 and they seem to be rather cheap and popular device these days. Anyway, for some reason sometimes when watching youtube or entering a video chat I notice that Firefox does not send audio for bluetooth headphones. It plays sound correctly when I switch sound to built-in or secondary display speakers, but bluetooth headphones just don't get any sound.
</p><p>This issue vanish for a moment if I play sound on another app, for example Spotify.
</p><p>What is even more annoying is I have noticed that on some video chats, like Google Meet or usosweb video-chat the sound just don't want to play when I have a microphone turned on. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, it is completely random but always happens with Firefox only.
</p><p>As you can imagine this is extremely annoying, because when someone stops talking or the music stops playing, the headphones just stop receiving sound again.
</p><p>Like I said earlier this is not an issue with the hardware because all the other apps work perfectly. Only firefox seems to have issues. The problem's been so annyoing lately that I finally decided to write about it since I just cannot put my speakers full on when two of my flatmates are working remotely at the same hours.

Click here to visit our frequently asked questions about HTML5 video. ""
</p><p>I've tried it in safe mode but it still didn't work, what puzzled me most was the fact that normal videos are played normally as they should. Unfortunately to watch some lives I had to start chrome because everything works as it should.
Thanks in advance.

(1) It does not preserve my window arrangement. I use multiple desktops for various tasks, and they each have related browser windows.

I am having an issue with bookmarks and sync.
</p><p>Steps followed:
My mom has Firefox for Android (68.0), and a Windows 10 computer with Firefox (75.0).
She had not used the computer in about a month. When opening the computer, I noticed that her desktop bookmarks did not sync with her mobile bookmarks (some folders she had renamed/deleted on her phone still appeared on her desktop). I tried to manually sync on the computer. Nothing. When I checked her mobile I noticed that sync was off on her mobile, so I turned it on. I tried to sync again on her computer, logged off her account on computer, logged in again, tried to sync, then restarted the computer, reopened Firefox, tried to sync but nothing.
I connected to her Firefox account on my tablet, and her mobile bookmarks synced perfectly on my tablet.
So I uninstalled Firefox on her computer completely (deleting the APPDATA Firefox file) and reinstalled it.
</p><p>The problem now:
</p>
<ol><li>when opening the bookmark menu on the computer, the ""mobile bookmarks"" folder does not show. I went into ""about:config"", searched for ""mobi"", but the option ""browser.bookmarks.showMobileBookmarks"" does not appear at all.
</li><li>when searching for a mobile bookmark in the address bar, Firefox finds the bookmark (I see the URL) but it does not show as stared and when I click on it, the blue star does not appear. But there is some kind of sync working apparently, since Firefox recognizes the URLs of sites that are bookmarked on mobile!
</li></ol>
<p>I am not sure what the issue is and would appreciate some help.
Thanks very much for your time.

</p><p>In each case I see none of the accounts, folders, address book, ... or anything shows when I open Thunderbird. 
</p><p>With a clean install of 60.9.0, I then replaced just the <strong>contents</strong> of the newly created profile folder (C:\Users\lbake\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\zi3wsnpl.default) with the <em>contents</em> of the old profile I wish to use because replacing just the contents was suggested in <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data#w_restoring-a-profile-backup"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data#w_restoring-a-profile-backup</a>.

I normally run Thunderbird under Windows. After running Thunderbird under Fedora Linux 32 to check my emails, I get locked out of my Thunderbird profile when I try to run Thunderbird under Windows, thereby denying me access to my emails. Both operating systems access the same Thunderbird profile which is located in the Windows partition.
This is a MAJOR PROBLEM to me.
</p><p>Description
I have set up my computer to be able to boot to either Windows 7, Linux Mint 18.3 or Fedora Linux 32. I run Windows about 90% of the time.
I use Thunderbird as my email client. My profile contains 7 accounts from three email service providers. 5 of those accounts are POP3, and two are IMAP (Gmail accounts).
When I am running Linux I sometimes want to access my Thunderbird email (without having to re-boot my computer into Windows) so I altered the Thunderbird profile.ini file on the Linux Mint partition, so that it points to the Thunderbird Profile on my Windows partition instead. I do this by altering the profiles.ini file (in the Linux Home/.Thunderbird directory) so that it reads (in part).
[Profile0]
Name=default
</p>
<ol><li> IsRelative=1
</li></ol>
<p>IsRelative=0
</p>
<ol><li>
</li><li> Path=baxn61zj.default
</li></ol>
<p>Path=/media/WinC/Users/mike/AppData/Roaming/Thunderbird/Profiles/mzf9na1s.default
Default=1
</p>
<ol><li>
</li></ol>
<p>This method works very well with Linux Mint (which uses Thunderbird ver 60.6.1). I can check my emails and send emails, no matter which OS I am running, and they are all stored under my Thunderbird Profile on the Windows partition. And when I boot to Windows and run Thunderbird, all my emails are correct and in the right place. I can swap from Windows to Linux Mint often and get easy access to my Thunderbird profile with either Operating System. It is a great system and demonstrates the robustness of Thunderbird profiles.
BUT the same does not work with Thunderbird under Fedora 32. When I run Thunderbird (ver 68.7) under Fedora Linux 32 it fetches emails and sends emails correctly, but later when I reboot to Windows and try to run Thunderbird, Thunderbird refuses to run and it gives me the following error window.
""A newer version of Thunderbird may have made changes to your profile which are no longer compatible with this older version ...
Creating a new profile requires ...""
</p><p>Thunderbird will NOT open my profile or and will NOT give me access to my emails, even though both OSs are running the same version of Thunderbird i.e., 68.7.
I am running Thunderbird 68.7 on both the Windows partition and the Fedora 32 partition. However the Linux Mint partition runs Thunderbird 60.6.1.
This is a MAJOR PROBLEM because it means that if I open my emails with Thunderbird under Fedora Linux 32, I am thereafter locked out of my emails when I run Windows/Thunderbird.
Windows/Thunderbird 68.7 does not foul up Linux Fedora 32/Thunderbird 68.7 under Linux Fedora, but the reverse, running Thunderbird 68.7 under Linux Fedora, fouls up Windows/Thunderbird 68.7 badly.
I have been able to identify which files in my profile are changed by Thunderbird 68.7 under Fedora. And the change happens simply by starting Thunderbird and shutting it down - no other actions. I can provide more information about this issue if needed.
In addition, I found that after Fedora/Thunderbird has fouled up my profile, if I then boot to Linux Mint 18.3 and run Thunderbird 60.6.1, it does some ""magic"" and undoes the ""fouls up"" or whatever Fedora/Thunderbird did, and enables Windows/Thunderbird to read the profile and give me access to my email again.
Very frustrating and unnerving.

Mes messages entrants sont rangés par année dans Thunderbird.
Pour éviter de sauvegarder tous mes dossiers annuels de messages à chaque sauvegarde, je voudrais me contenter de sauvegarder le dossier de l'année. Pour être sûr en faisant cela de disposer d'une sauvegarde, il faut que Thunderbird supporte de voir remplacer un dossier vide de messages par un dossier ayant les messages d'une année. 
Est-ce le cas ? Ou est-ce que d'autres fichiers que celui ayant le dossier contiennent des informations sur les messages du dossier ?

When I click in some boxes, the size of the space bar changes. This results in me putting a period instead of a space. This is especially problematic if I am trying to put search terms into the address bar in firefox. I try to put a space, but a period is inserted instead and this results in firefox seeing it as a url instead of search terms. It is a great deal of trouble to then try and correct it and it is very frustrating. Can you allow me to disable the behaviour of the keyboard where it changes the key layout? Keyboard layout should not change, it works against human habitual behaviour. I cant type reliably if the key layout keeps changing. 
This does not happen with some other keyboards such as hackers keyboard.
I spoke to samsung and they claimed to have no control over it, saying that firefox is the responsible party in this case.

Began reactivating my add-ons one by one and running them for two days before adding another.  HTTPS, when added, preformed properly for about 15-20 minutes and then the CPU percentage spiked to 90% plus and would not drop.  Restarting FF said it was still running.  FF continues to run even though it has been shut down.  The process has to be killed before FF will restart.  The rogue process will run indefinitely if it is not killed.  Seems only to happen if HTTPS Everywhere is activated.  I have tested add-ons one at a time with no others active.  This is the only one that causes this behavior.  I really like that add-on but find its use prohibitive due to this problem.  There is no place on the add-on website to report this.  Should it be reported as a bug and, if so, where?

My first Mac was a Mac SE and my first browser was Netscape Navigator. I run the latest (75.0, I believe) Firefox as my default browser. In addition, I have Firefox Developer Edition that I use for website development and other tasks. Both have been running simultaneously for two or more years. Each has a unique profile. I have not had any problems until today.

</p><p>Today, I was helping a friend, showing her how to create a new MacOS user. I created a new, non-admin, account while logged in as admin. Both copies of Firefox were running. I created this account with my existing AppleID (an AppleID shared with my admin account). I shut down and restarted, went through the setup dialog boxes, and logged in as the new user. The new user account started up fine. I know I opened FaceTime. I may have opened Firefox, but I cannot be sure. Then, I shut down and logged in as admin. Firefox is set to as a startup item on this account. I got the ""Profile Missing"" dialog box. 
</p><p>I have spend the last 6 hours trying to get Firefox or FFDE to run. I have deleted and reinstalled both, downloading new versions from the Mozilla website. I have also reinstalled from Time Machine. In each case, I have tried both with the original (with my two profiles) Application Support &gt;&gt; Firefox folder present and also removed from the Library folder. When the Firefox folder is removed from the Library folder, Firefox or FFDE creates a new Firefox folder and gives the same Profile Missing dialog box. No new profile.ini file is created in the new Application Support &gt;&gt; Firefox folder. 
</p><p>I have also deleted any ""org.mozilla..."" preference files I could find in the admin Library folder and the System Library folder. 
</p><p>I have read all the user forum/tech notes/blog articles at Mozilla specifying how to recover profiles and/or recover lost data. I can never get Firefox to run; thus, I'm unable to get to the point of profile recovery.

I've been having a spot of trouble with Firefox since version 75: whenever I stream video content on any website I get interstitial artifacts in the video for one frame multiple times at random through the video (here is an example of what I mean: <a href=""https://imgur.com/a/58g1WCV"" rel=""nofollow"">https://imgur.com/a/58g1WCV</a> [one frame before, during, and after])
</p><p>This hadn't happen for the 7 months I've had my set-up like it is and only started recently. I've reverted to older GPU drivers, updated to the newest drivers, removed any recent add-ons, and refreshed Firefox back to stock--nothing seems to positively affect it. I'm thinking this is a version 75 issue since its dropping on April 7th matches very closely to when this started happening. I've also streamed in other browsers (Brave, Edge) and these artifacts do not show up. It also doesn't matter if it's full-screen or not. I've streamed on two other Windows 10 laptops that have 1080p displays unzoomed and they do not present these artifacts.
</p><p>I will say, too, that I've launched Firefox in safe mode and didn't notice the glitching happening, and upon following Mozilla's troubleshooting guide I think I was able to determine that hardware acceleration is causing the problem (as leaving it off seemed to have stopped the artifacts).

</p><p><br>
You can get Thunderbird Portable and LOTS of other portable apps from &lt;<a href=""https://portableapps.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://portableapps.com</a>&gt;, and do always be sure to update from whichever version they have there to the newest version immediately after installation.  Thunderbird Portable (or ""Mozilla Thunderbird, Portable Edition"") *<em><strong>IS</strong></em>* Thunderbird, just packaged in a way that gives many new advantages.  The same goes for all their apps.  While they may not have the latest version of a program repackaged as a portable app yet, updating a portable app after you get it is never done any differently than the ways they normally get updated.  NOTE: You do NOT have to get or use the <a href=""http://PortableApps.com"" rel=""nofollow"">PortableApps.com</a> Platform (suite) in order to run their individual portable apps.  And they have LOTS more than just Thunderbird and Firefox, LOTS!  And their offerings are all free, because they only repackage free, open-source software!
</p><p>There are other sources and makers of portable apps than just &lt;<a href=""https://portableapps.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://portableapps.com</a>&gt; , to be sure.  They may do a few things differently, but the definition of a portable app is basically the same.  Just search for ""What is a Portable App?"" using <a href=""http://DuckDuckgo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">DuckDuckgo.com</a> or your favorite search engine, and you'll get multiple good results.  Read more than one for a better overall understanding, but the basics are simple.  Much of what I have here will actually repeat some of what you'll find there, but not all.  And maybe I'll phrase something better or have an example or use-case that strikes you better; we'll see.
</p><p>What's good about portable apps?  They do everything and are used in precisely the same way as non-portable apps, from the user's perspective.  Their ""installation"" is really nothing but unzipping a single directory and all its contents (including any subdirectories); everything needed to run it is in that directory.  You copy/move/delete (deleting is uninstalling) the whole program just by copying/moving/deleting the single program directory.  This makes it very easy to back up an entire program (including everything you've done to customize it, and any data you don't store outside of its folders).  OS drive crash?  No reinstallation or configuration worries if you have it backed up; just copy the single program directory from backup.  And no worries about a registry or conflicting DLLs or anything like that, when you install or delete; it's self-contained, so installations and deletions are clean.  You can move or copy the program to a different location -- even on a flash drive or another computer -- without having to do anything differently; it doesn't care what drive letter it's on at different times and handles that automatically.  On a portable drive like a flash drive or SD card, you can take your whole program with all its data, configuration, settings, etc. with you to different computers.
</p><p>(<em>I actually started using FirefoxPortable and ThunderbirdPortable years ago, when I had a job with a lot of free time at different places each night, each with a computer I could use, and I didn't own or want to buy a laptop or tablet.  I carried both on a flash drive, back and forth between my home PC and work.   I'd even copy them down to my PC's hard drive for faster speeds when I was at home, then copy back up to the flash drive when I was done or going to leave home.  [I haven't seen a web-based e-mail interface I like anywhere near as much as ""TB"", and have only seen one that was somewhat reasonable for my tastes.]  Without having to buy a laptop, and without installing any software on a work computer or harming anything there, I had the same browser and e-mail client at home and at every computer at work -- not just the same ""model"" of programs, the *very same programs*, just as if I was on the same computer.  I didn't bother to get a laptop until years later when a new boss decided we shouldn't use the computers for anything but company business at all; it was a temporary crackdown but long enough to force me to spend more money than a flash drive cost :-) .</em>)
</p><p>Really, I just treat my *portable* programs like data now, and its great!  (<em>Oh, how I wish my tax software would be available as a portable app!  As it is now, I don't update after I send in my taxes, so that if my tax authority ever comes around to ask questions, I can show them the software and say, ""This is how the program calculated it right then, what the program said!"" without worries that it will do something differently than when I sent in my taxes.  But if anything happens that makes me have to reinstall the software from original discs or files again, it will either have to be not-updated-at-all or updated-with-all-the-latest-changes -- and that won't be proof of how the program was doing things when I sent in my taxes.  If it were portable, I could back up the whole program and not just the data files!</em>)
</p><p>You can also even have multiple installations of a single program on the same computer, without any special steps or obstacles!  (Although, they may or may not be able to run at the same time, depending on the computer.) <em>For instance, on my laptop, instead of using different user profiles within the Firefox web browser for when my roommate has to borrow my laptop -- rarely, but occasionally -- I have my Firefox Portable on my data drive, and a whole other copy of Firefox Portable on my desktop just for them, and I occasionally create a new copy for special projects I want to work on separately from everything else.  I've just never dealt with user profiles before, never had to.  This is clean and easy for me, and *everything* about each copy of the program is independent and independently configurable.  What my roommate does to *their* copy doesn't affect mine, not my history, work in progress, cosmetics, add-ons, nothing.  and vice-versa.</em>  ...  This kind of usage does use some more storage space on my drives (be they hard drives or flash drives or SD cards or whatever), but I have that kind of space available now.
</p><p>And in fact, that's what backup copies of my portable apps really are:  fully functioning standalone programs.  They'll run just the same way.  For both Thunderbird and Firefox, I make a copy every time before I allow an update to happen.  I shut down the program completely first.  I delete the current backup completely, never knowing whether just copying over it will leave behind any extra things that might cause problems.  And then I make a fresh copy of my ""in-use"" folder, using the same name with ""-- BACKUP COPY"" appended.  Clever huh?  Only after that is done will I update my in-use copy of the program.  Then if any functionality -- built-in or add-on -- has broken or changed in a way I don't like with the update, I just delete the ""in-use"" copy and replace it with a copy of the backup.  That's why I started keeping the backups, in fact.  [Note: I would still have to deal with anything I'd done in a program since updating, like keeping newly downloaded mail or bookmarks or history, or whatever else.  But hopefully, I see any major problem right away.]  At that point, they're identical, and I could run either one if I wanted.  Need something I permanently deleted from my POP3 Thunderbird account, for instance?  If it was there at the time of my last backup copy, I just close Thunderbird (""in-use"" copy), open Thunderbird (backup copy), and get it.  Simple.
</p><p>If you find yourself wanting to test multiple configurations, or uninstalling and reinstalling particular software a lot, or trying to troubleshoot problems based on different set-ups, consider using the portable version of the same program if there is one.
</p><p>Portable apps are good.

</p><p>Anyway, I rand the dedupe feature and then I ran the validators and now my bookmarks are reduced to 2000. I went through all the 2000 BM's manually to make sure the add-ons did their job. I caught a lot of obsolete BM's out of the 2000 that were specifically owned by hugedomains dot com and they were all redirected to shady malicious sites(I checked them all in virustotal dot com) and saved as a permanent BM in my FF!  How can any tool rewrite/redirect my FF BM's? What tool did this, the 3 plugins/addons I used above or hugedomains? If latter, do I need to report hugedomains to authorities? A last question: When I ran the bookmark checkers to validate the 2000 sites, does that pee-off the site admins as their sites are pinged? I noticed some sites like Facebook, Linkedin, Monster, etc don't allow remote checking and bookmark checkers report such URLs as http 500.  Thanks

I get a message saying my browser is not supported/out of date, although I do have the most up to date version of Firefox installed. I only have this problem on my iPad Pro, not my Mac or iPhone. And I do not have this problem when I use Safari instead. 
Now the problem has spread to Amazon. I bought a CD yesterday which featured a free mp3 download, but when I clocked on the invitation to download/play the music, I got a message saying my browser was unsupported. (I can of course use the Amazon music app but that's not the point.)
I have tried all the simple fixes which i can find suggested. None of them work, I know others have had this problem and I recall seeing something saying that Firefox just hadn't got around to addressing some issues about compatibility with certain sites. 
I am a long time Firefox user and would be very reluctant to have to change to another browser, particularly as the problem is restricted to my iPad only. Has anybody got any advice, or causes for optimism about this issue being sorted out for users?

</p><p>Hello,
</p><p>I generated a custom CA and used it to sign a server cert. I imported it in the system trusted-ca (ArchLinux).
Chromium, Falkon and cURL all accept the custom cert but Firefox does not.
</p><p>The Root CA is listed in the Certificate/CA list of Firefox (as System Trust) and IS trusted to authenticate web servers.
</p><p>Nonetheless, Firefox keeps displaying the SSL_ERROR_BAD_CERT_DOMAIN error claiming that jellyfin.media.0 is not part of the trusted names which are jellyfin.media.0, ....
</p><p>I'm using Firefox 75.0 (distributed by manjaro).
</p><p>I believe that this problem is Firefox related since the cert works with other browser and curl.
Thank you for your help!
