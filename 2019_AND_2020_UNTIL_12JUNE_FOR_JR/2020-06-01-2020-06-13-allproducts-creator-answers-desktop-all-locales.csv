Like any extension that modifies the page body (as far as I know), it cannot modify certain pages and sites, such as <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org</a>. For obvious reasons, it can also not modify PDFs opened in Firefox' built-in viewer. However, Firefox seems to always disallow modification if the URL ends in <em>.pdf</em>, regardless of whether that page actually is a PDF file. This becomes a problem on Wikipedia, where <em>File:</em> page URLs always end in their respective file extension, although they are completely regular HTML pages (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ExtIPA_chart_(2015).pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">example</a>). This makes it so that you get effectively flashbanged every time you view that kind of page. </p><p>I assume this would also happen on sites with URL naming schemes similar to Wikipedia's, but I can't think of any to try and test it. </p><p>On an only marginally related note, because official Mozilla pages are also protected from page body modification, writing this post wasn't exactly pleasant either. </p>",firefox-770;customize;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,customize,en-US,1323670;1323674;1323680;1323684;1323689;1323698;,dertrutinator,true,williamzijl7,6

You know like when it says 'Sign up with Google or Facebook' and you just click that and enter your facebook/google login. So I'm confused now. Does that mean my facebook login details have been breached? Or has doing it that way actually protected my details?

The mouse cursor changes to a ""loading"" cursor and starts flickering forever, trying to start Firefox. This is bad enough for my whole system to behave strangely, e.g. mouse clicks will randomly not register or release. </p><p>Upon inspecting the task manager, I find that `consent.exe` repeatedly pops up and disappears. I assume it crashes and then firefox tries to restart, repeating in an infinite loop ... I only recently found a dubious/hacky way to stop this without logging out or restarting my pc: When I forcefully rename `C:/Windows/System32/consent.exe` via console, e.g. to `.../consent.exe_`, Firefox will crash ""properly"" with an error message and I can rename it back. </p><p>I have no idea what this `consent.exe` does or why it is called, which makes finding the cause or fixing the issue very hard.. </p><p><br> <strong>Details / attempted fixes</strong> </p><p>The most recent time I had this issue, it appeared after trying to open an external link while Firefox was open. Firefox then found a new update and started automatically updating to the newest version (77.0.1), before trying to open the link and giving an error message (I don't remember what it was..). To properly apply the update I closed Firefox, tried to open it again, and I started getting this infinite crash loop. </p><p>This is not the first time I had this exact same issue, but the cause seems to vary. The first time I encountered this was back when there was a buggy Windows update, which if I read my logs correctly seems to have been at the end of February 2020. As far as I can remember at this time, the issue appeared immediately after restarting my PC and updating Windows (no opening of external links involved). The only way I managed to fix it was by uninstalling that Windows update. I disabled the following updates for some months. At this time I assumed the cause was the buggy Windows update, but since then I had the same issue 4 more times. Of the times I can remember the issue appeared immediately after </p> <ul><li> updating windows </li><li> ?? </li><li> ?? </li><li> clicking an external link </li><li> clicking an external link &gt; automatic Firefox update &gt; restart Firefox &gt; crash </li></ul> <p>Every time I got this issue I tried many things to fix it, including </p> <ul><li> restarting Firefox </li><li> restarting the PC </li><li> deleting my Firefox profiles in `%AppData%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles` and `%AppData%\..\Local\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles` </li></ul> <p>none of the above worked any time I had this issue - nonetheless the issue would disappear randomly without me knowing what fixed it. </p><p>The first time when it was seemingly caused by the buggy Windows update, I even uninstalled and reinstalled all of Firefox, including deleting my Profiles in AppData. Even then, the issue persisted on a completely clean and barebone install of Firefox. However, since then it is seemingly caused by opening external links and the problem always randomly disappeared before I got to try a clean Firefox install. </p><p>The most recent time, the issue disappeared while I was trying `firefox.exe --version`, `firefox.exe --help` to find out my Firefox version (I don't know the correct commands, so nothing happened). This did not work, but when I then tried to start Firefox again, I got about 10 or so error messages on the first attempt (unfortunately, I don't remember the error message..), and then the issue was gone on the second attempt to restart Firefox. </p><p>One other random guess I have is that some of my about:config settings may be related, in particular I completely disabled any links from opening popups, be it a new tab or window. But this sounds really like a bug and I certainly do not want to undo this setting. </p> <hr> <p>In the end I am not even sure if this is a Firefox or Windows issue, and I am also not sure what would be a better place to look for support. Should I submit the above as bug report? </p><p>I am also very reluctant to try to reproduce the issue since I have no idea what the fix is and spent hours on it every time. </p>",firefox-770;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1323316;,chris237,false,false,1

Problem: This must be executed manually and emails are not copied, but deleted from the server.  </p><p>2.: One single filter to copy all emails without condition, executed in a certain time interval: This feature does not distinguish new emails from emails that have been copied previously. So I will end up with hundreds of local copies of each email. </p><p>3.: Two filters- one to copy incoming emails, one to copy outgoing emails: This is the closest I could get, but if I send an email using another device, no local copy will be made as this filter is only applied to emails sent by Thunderbird. </p><p>Is there any other possibility I may have missed? </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1323165;,mar.sie,false,false,1

On conspicuous and inconvenient result has been the disappearance from the upper toolbar of the several items that allow one to control the use of the browser in various ways:  File, Edit, View, History, Bookmarks, Tools, Window, Help.  Access to some of these functions has evidently been relocated to small icons appearing in the upper right-hand corner of the browser-window.  Some, however, seem to appear nowhere.  Of particular annoyance to me personally are the following:  Previously (a) under ""File"", the ""New Tab"" opener seems nowhere to be found--as far as I can see, one can only open a ""New Window""; (b) under ""Edit"", the ""Undo"", ""Redo"", and ""Delete"" functions seem nowhere to be found.  Finally, is there no way to restore the previous much more accessible and versatile presentation of these functions in the toolbar of the desktop, rather than having them tucked away in the browser-window? </p>",firefox-770;other;desktop;mac-os;,firefox,other,en-US,1323105;,wgb.888,false,false,1

I'm using Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS, GNOME 3.28.2 with a 64-bit OS.  </p><p>Recently, I noticed that I could not save PDFs from the internet to my hard drive when I was using Firefox. Normally, if I had opened a PDF in Firefox, I could press 'Ctrl + S' on my keyboard and a save dialog window would appear. Now however, the save dialog window would not appear. No error messages appeared, so I have no screenshots to show. The only thing I could do to save the PDF was to click on the 'Download' icon in Firefox's PDF reader. Right-clicking on links to PDFs and selecting 'Save As' would yield the same result: no save dialog window, nothing. </p><p>I thought that the problem might be because my version of Firefox was not up to date, so I ran 'sudo apt-get update' and 'sudo apt-get install firefox' in the terminal. I also updated the flash plugin.  </p><p>Afterwards, I noticed that I could not upload files from my hard drive as an attachment for e-mails.

This resolved the problem. I can now save PDF files by pressing 'Ctrl+S' on my keyboard and i can upload files.  </p><p>I'm reporting this because I think other people might encounter the same problem as I did.

Tis a relief :) </p><p>So the article above says to check this list @ <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/77.0.1/system-requirements/#software-requirements"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/77.0.1/system-requirements/#software-requirements</a> for ""required libraries"".   I am really good at the command line except for checking library dependencies. :/ </p><p>Last link shows these 5: </p> <ul><li> Bulleted list item    GTK+ 3.4 or higher </li></ul> <pre>   * Bulleted list item    GLib 2.22 or higher    * Bulleted list item    Pango 1.22 or higher    * Bulleted list item    <a href=""http://X.Org"" rel=""nofollow"">X.Org</a> 1.0 or higher (1.7 or higher is recommended) </pre> <ul><li> Bulleted list item        libstdc++ 4.7 or higher </li></ul> <p>My fear is i'll have to search around a while for the exact package name since sometimes capitalization and dashes matter when using apt, aptitude, or synaptic. </p><p>Here's what I am trying so far.   I started with libstdc++ since that's all lower case. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ $ apt list | grep libstdc++ | grep -v unstable ... ... (super long list of lots of different libstdc++) ... libstdc++6/stable 8.3.0-6 i386 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ So since that ends with version 8.3 and that's higher than the ""4.7 or higher"" in the official list above, then I'm good. (By the way, just a plain `apt list libstdc++` returned no results.) </p><p>And substituting the word 'pango' in the above command gives a similarly long list that looks good, i think. Same with 'gtk3', 'glib2', and 'xorg'. </p><p>Oh, i think i've answered my own question :) but maybe went the scenic route with my command since i did not know the exact package names. </p><p>Anybody have a faster way of checking for these?  Pretty please? :) </p><p>P.S. By the way, I'm using Debian but in my experience it wouldn't matter if i was using Arch or even one of the BSD's right now.  Yes, tools are slightly different like apt/dpkg, or ports but am mostly curious for what exact package names to search for to save me time. :) </p><p>Thanks, you all rock.

No matter what I do, I get an error message from Windows claiming that it can't find firefox.exe, even when this is the result of double-clicking that exact file. This does not happen for any other software, including the portable version of Firefox (which is useless, since nothing is saved and I need my addons). I'm beginning to think that this is the result of either an absurd mistake or deliberate action from Microsoft, as there has been more than one Windows update within the day, and I have noticed other weird issues like my desktop background occasionally just being removed from existence for no reason. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1322344;1322738;1322746;,phyremaster,true,cor-el,3

I hit ""t"" on my keyboard and the autofill suggests going to <a href=""http://twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">twitter.com</a>.  As I type the ""m"", the autofill fills out the rest of the address bar with <a href=""http://T-lz.com"" rel=""nofollow"">T-lz.com</a>.   </p><p>I'm not sure what <a href=""http://T-lz.com"" rel=""nofollow"">T-lz.com</a> is, nor do I have any desire to access the site.  When this happens though, I start to backspace on that url and suddenly, the address bar goes to the word ""T-Mobile"".   </p><p>Hitting backspace just once fills out the address bar to ""<a href=""http://T-Mobile.com"" rel=""nofollow"">T-Mobile.com</a>"".  After I try to clear the address bar and start over, I start getting bookmark suggestions for anything that has ""T"" in it. </p><p>I have scoured the internet, as well as the troubleshooting documentation on <a href=""http://Mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Mozilla.org</a> and I cannot find anything that has helped.  I've uninstalled, reinstalled the app on my iPhone.  I've also double and triple checked that I do not have any bookmarks related to T-Mobile.  But no matter what I do, I cannot get this to work properly.  Additionally, this issue does NOT happen on Firefox for Mac or PC but it does happen on my iPad as well.  I am using the latest and greatest iOS versions on my iPhone and iPad. </p><p>Any help that can be provided or suggested would be greatly appreciated. </p>",firefox-ios-not-working-expected;ios;,ios,firefox-ios-not-working-expected,en-US,"",jedimasterkyle88,false,false,0

Mozilla Firefox becomes very slow for Google-based services (Google Search, Gmail, YouTube) and unresponsive when HTTP3 is enabled in about:config. Since QUIC is mostly a Google invention and Google services are the ones that utilize it the most, I wonder if Google deliberately slows down Firefox-based QUIC. The negative effect of HTTP3 in Firefox browsers with Google services is something that I test and experience on multiple networks, devices, device types, and versions of Firefox. I use Wireshark to see if QUIC is the protocol that causes slow downs and it is, but only for Google-based services. There are other non-Google QUIC services and they are actually faster/quicker with Firefox HTTP3 flag enabled.

In this version, but also all the previous versions, I have a problem while scrolling long web pages. Once I have scrolled down quite a bit to far below the immediately visible area, there will be a horizontal area across the entire browser window that does not show anything or is blacked out. It appears as if that area is covering up the info below it (as in a lower layer).  If I continue to scroll further down, these blacked out areas appear regularly. This forces me to switch to another browser (Chrome, Edge) where the problem does not occur, just so that I can read that info or access the buttons etc. hidden in FF.  I am working with a Lenovo Laptop attached to a docking station and two extra 27 inch screens that are turned to vertical and stand side by side.  The attached Screenshot gives you an idea. It was taken from this page: <a href=""https://www.afrikarma.de/safari-lodges-und-camps-in-afrika/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.afrikarma.de/safari-lodges-und-camps-in-afrika/</a> with the parameter for number of items to display in the table below the map set to ""Alle"".

And the problem is also unrelated to a specific website.

I lost all my bookmarks because apparently my password (which I did not have) was the only way to access them and resetting my password meant of course they are gone.  Really sad, as the Chrome browser is a pig - why does EVERY web site you ever accessed have to stay open?? Weird!!   Is there a description somewhere of how to navigate the new Firefox.  I have tried to get somewhere using the 3 boxes that open in the initial screen but they are dead ends.  Odd but then most of the stuff I see is ""Intuitive"".

I can no longer use Firefox to pay online with StateFarm.  This started suddenly a few months ago. I had no problem navigating to the payment login page with State Farm, then one day I clicked the link and received an error page. I called State Farm Technical service and they suggested I try another browser.  It works fine in Chrome.  I like exclusively using Firefox.  Can this link be made to work on Firefox again? 2.  All of a sudden Firefox stopped opening links in webpage.  It doesn't open a new tab, it doesn't open Adobe Acrobat.  All I get is a flash of the download arrow.  I then need to go through multiple steps to download/open/save whatever it is I'm looking for.  If I don't see the flashing download arrow, it just looks like nothing has happened.  I'm assuming this change came in some update recently.  I have looked in options, but don't see how I can reset the options so links open automatically.   3.  In Options, I noticed a banner iYour browser is being managed by your organization.  I use Avast.  Your article about this suggests turning off Avast for web browsing, but that is advice in direct opposition to my computer guy.  I don't care about the banner if I know why it's there.

1290343,2020-06-08 11:51:47 -0800,2020-06-08T12:02:11Z,Resource consuming inside and outside differs significantly,"<p>I investigated the immediate cause Firefox hangs or responses with long delay. Mostly, the immediate cause is that Firefox writes to disk a huge amount of bytes. Disk operations are slow, block calling thread (at least), and consume battery charge intensively. All this is of great importance to portable devices equipped by HDD (my case). The second bottleneck is memory page thrashing caused by excessive memory consuming and a lot of unloaded memory pages. When these two factors occur on the same disk, this doubles or triples disk response time, hanging a lot of processes in the system (including the firefox processes). This effect I observe every time when running Firefox longer one hour intensively web-surfing. I used ProcessHacker to measure memory consuming, disk and network operations in bytes. Then I compared these metrics with Firefox reports ""about:performance"", ""about:cache"" and ""about:memory"". This comparison exemplified that resource consuming from inside and outside looks very different. The second conclusion is that network usage ten or more times lower than disk usage, which should not be even if content is unpacked and saved. And the main question is why disk usage are close to memory consuming. This speaks in favor of the fact that disk usage is inefficient and surplus: most data can be stored in memory. Let's consider the attached screenshots. The first part of screenshot 'Firefox external metrics@77.0.1' consists of two parts with ProcessHacker window and contains the following external metrics of the parent firefox process: </p> <ul><li> Working set = 2 GB (summed over children processes) </li><li> Virtual size = 3.25 GB </li><li> Network total bytes = 287.1 MB </li><li> Disk total bytes = 3.02 GB </li><li> Disk write bytes = 2.48 GB </li><li> Disk read bytes = 551.23 MB </li></ul> <p>The firefox process structure is in the second part of that screenshot. The same observation -- excessive resource consuming exemplified by the same metrics. To estimate total memory consuming, I closed Firefox and compared memory usage by ""System information"" (ProcessHacker's tool): the commit charge level decreased by 4.2 GB and the physical memory level decreased by 2.7 GB. This means that 1.5 GB memory pages are in the paging file, i.e. stored on the disk! In comparison with Windows 7 memory consuming, we see 748 MB versus 2.7 GB in physical memory. Does Firefox indeed execute so many tasks and provide so many functions and deliver so much value as Windows 7 Pro operating system? The comparison Firefox versus MS Word 2010 with 20 opened documents (about 200 MB RAM consumed) leads to the same observation: the former has much higher resource consuming per functionality/value. </p><p>However, Firefox's ""about:cache"" and ""about:performance"" don't report such resource consuming: see the according screenshots. I summed memory usage by web pages enumerated in ""about:performance"": all 16 loaded web pages consumed 522 MB in total instead of 2.7GB physical memory and 4.2 GB virtual memory. What does Firefox really do?! This is why I suppose that Firefox executes hidden extraneous tasks. To those who would like to analyze Firefox's memory report in detail, I saved and published it: <a href=""https://yadi.sk/d/S9Z4AERdS8LHWg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://yadi.sk/d/S9Z4AERdS8LHWg</a>  </p><p>My point is that disk I/O operations should be decreased significantly in order to prevent Firefox from hanging and to decrease response time on user actions. There are several measures to do it. First, stop using RAM in uncontrolled and ineffective manner as we saw it even on 16 web pages. This means estimating and measuring memory overhead per content byte, per user-level function and per delivered value. Second, stop using disk-based databases, use in-memory databases instead. Third, use effective data structures and data architecture. To prevent memory page unloading, use OS API to disallow unloading of desired memory pages using proper attribute. Yes, if your data/programming languages do not satisfy these critical requirements, use another one. If your data/programming technology do not satisfy these critical requirements, just change it. If your values interfere with this approach, then make the browser’s mission to be the main value -- visualizing hypertext to the user quickly, cheaply, conveniently and effectively. All other values around it have lower priority, remember! No one need safety and transparency and so on if the browser hangs with other process in the system or web page loads more than 0.5 second on a real device. This means you should not suppose the modern or superpower device -- you should suppose any device with one CPU of 1.5 GHz and 2 GB of RAM. These resources are enough to display even 100 pages of 1 MB each in size, obliviously. Just because 1920x1600 = 3072000 bytes (one byte per pixel), i.e. about 3 MB per screen image. The main thing the browser do is it transforms 1 MB of input content into 3 MB image of output. Five or eight GB of RAM is too excessive to this operation, isn't it? </p>",firefox-770;desktop;fix-problems;windows-7;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1321683;,alexworad,false,false,1

Now this doesn't happen when in normal mode meaning not in picture in picture mode, So basicly i'm saying could you guys look into making picture in picture full screen mode not make the screen go to sleep like in a normal player, I understand I can also turn off picture in picture mode or turn my screen auto turn off after a few minutes off but I would think it would be much better if the picture in picture full screen mode worked the same as watching something in a normal player which doesn't make your screen turn off, Not sure if its a bug or was just over looked either way thought I would let you guys know. Also want to add that picture in picture mode is a great idea, I have always wanted to beable to watch something while working when only having 1 screen and picture in picture works great for that keep up the good work!

I am also not alone in this matter because as soon as the change was established, communities popped within hours to fix the problem. The old way of fixing this eyesore of an issue was the old about:config and changing around the settings then VIOLA! back to normal.  Now after the update to 77, the Megabar is back and forced down everyone's throat and the old about:config is no longer the fix to this terrible experience. Literally after an hour of this trashbar being up, videos and guides popped up to try to fix it. Whole communities have been formed to hate this feature and ask Firefox to change it, or at least make it optional to go back.  My question is, looking through google has only come up with the chrome.css(?) fix to this mess. Is there any way to change it back to the old url bar without having to go through the chrome.css fix or just uninstalling and reinstalling a previous Firefox or do I have to just migrate to another browser like Opera or Chromium? </p>",firefox-770;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1321449;1321451;1321460;1321467;1321590;1321789;1321792;1322832;1322866;1322892;1322903;1322922;1322937;,quizibo,false,false,13

Add search bar in toolbar: Select this setting if you prefer a <strong>separate search bar</strong>.  </pre> <p>But it seems logical to me that one would naturally assume that by separating the search bar from the address bar, that searches would no longer take place in the address bar.

It also doesn't fix the results issue which I would say is the most important. </p><p>I would like to know what I need to do so that: 1. The results it shows me are no longer based on frequent visit (basically, the pre-update search system, as is they are scattered and look messy, pulling many different sites in a seemingly random order and it's not particularly useful) 2. It no longer autocompletes results (IE. ""F"" autocompleting to ""<a href=""http://facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">facebook.com</a>"", this is always something that has bothered me regardless is context) 3.

I'm working to save people's lives against COVID-19, and Firefox, not Chrome is causing ALLof my gmail accounts to quickly and automatically sign out. For almost a month, and with great diligence and frustration in trying to troubleshoot this a couple of different ways (according to Mozilla and others)), nothing has prevailed.  </p><p>Could it be the great number of open windows and tabs that cause it, because that is my last (but not yet tested theory).  Most of the times the sign out occurs when the email draft automatically saves itself, and the site disconnects. How I know this, is gmail says it's trying to reconnect. There's also a message saying my hangouts isn't signed in, but neither is it signed in with Chrome  One more thing. Every day for the last 3 years, I use CC cleaner to remove cookies and cache, so it can't be that. You'll have to come up with something Mozilla hasn't yet thought of yet. </p><p>And lastly, Firefox Lockwise (when it was active), prevented me from finding my ""SAVED LOGINS"", gmail account. Not even the search engine could find it (both when Lockwise was active, and after I cancelled the account). This program prevented me from finding my own password, which was needed urgently. And now, I can't get rid of Lockwise, even after cancelling the account. Anf from what I see, I'm forced to sign up with the account again, just to ask this question. Nobody likes the bully, so please help me PERMANENTLY remove Lockwise from my system?

I searched for a way to remove it, found a solution that involved turning these to false: browser.urlbar.openViewOnFocus browser.urlbar.update1 browser.urlbar.update1.interventions browser.urlbar.update1.searchTips It solved my problem, had the bar back to the way I wanted it the day after the update rolled out and its been fine up to this point. Today, I'm using Firefox and the browser closed abruptly, so I clicked to reopen it and get an update. Once its done that awful bar is back again and its telling me to send a crash report. I send the report then go to reapply the solution I used before only to see that they are all still set to false but that bar is still popping out and my easy access drop down of sites I visit most is gone. Please, can anyone help me get rid of this bar. I've tried restarting the browser and no luck. I need a way to return it to how it was, I've tried using the new address bar, don't like it, and I do not want it at all.

I hated the URL bar that was added in 75 and found it back again in 77 so I tried to turn it off again. After finding that the only solution effectively broke the URL bar (switching browser.urlbar.disableExtendForTests to false for reference which stopped it from expanding at all, including to see the websites in the drop down) and no other setting changes did anything, I tried going back to version 76 since the URL bar remained as I had set it in 75. However, because of the profile protection, I would need to manually add everything back (on top of that, I couldn't restore the URL bar with the changes that worked in 75 anyway) so, deciding it wasn't worth the trouble, I updated back up to version 77. </p><p>Now, a few websites aren't loading correctly. For example, YouTube only loads gray placeholder boxes and the sidebar elements are completely unresponsive. Trying to load a video from history also doesn't work as the page just remains blank. YouTube isn't the only site with this issue either though they have varying degrees of functionality. However, I don't know why those sites aren't working while others that I would think are somewhat similar (IE. DeviantArt, Reddit) are working. While I don't think anything I changed in the about:config had anything to do with this as I only went through the URL stuff, I don't know for sure and is why I included the little backstory above. </p><p>I've tried refreshing the tab as well as closing Firefox completely and reopening it but the issue has persisted. </p><p>I tried uploading an image of what YouTube looks like. I'm not sure if it went through and I'm unable to see it on my end or if it isn't being accepted for another reason. </p>",websites;desktop;,firefox,websites,en-US,1321086;1321121;1321269;1321270;,mccool37,true,armanmailbox1,4

It's especially helpful when I only have one monitor. There are a couple of rough-edges I'd like to see tweaked. </p><p>1. I resize these windows all the time to put them where they'll fit when I'm doing something else, and it can finicky to resize the window quickly. It would be helpful if the areas you can grab the edges and corners of were exaggerated. For example, if when the user's mouse is near an edge or corner of the picture-in-picture window a handle pops-up around the given area that's larger than the 1pixal-ish default handle area. I've seen similar functionality in the art program GIMP for selection boxes. </p><p>2. The way the window acts when being resized isn't very intuitive. The corners work as expected, but since the corner areas are so small I often grab the sides and that can get frustrating. I now know that when grabbing the Bight and Bottom sides of the window the Top-Left corner is anchored while resizing. Similarly, when grabbing the Left and Top sides of the window the Bottom-Right corner is anchored.  That seems pretty intuitive when I type it out, what's the issue? Well, the problem comes when you are grabbing the window near the corners. If for example, I'm trying to grab the window by the Bottom-Left corner and miss (which I've done plenty) and grab the Bottom of the window. Now when I resize the window is anchored in the Top-Left instead of the Top-Right, which is the opposite of what I wanted and leads to some confusion and repositioning. What I would suggest, separate from the #1 solution, would be to break the sides of the window into three areas: Near-corner 1, Center, and Near-corner 2. When grabbing the window on the edge in one of the Near-corner areas, anchor the window at the opposite corner. When grabbing by the center of an edge anchor the window by the opposite center.  </p><p>Thank you for reading my long suggestion. I hope you don't find this to be a negative interaction. I truly enjoy Firefox, and I've very excited about your new Picture-in-picture feature. I hope you understand that this level of nit-picking can only come from a place of love!  </p><p>P.S: I'm very pleased to say that I did not include a third issue I had with the Spacebar Play/Pause functionality not working unless the Play button was the last object clicked on the window, because in the latest update it was gone! I want to thank whomever worked on that and let them know, someone did notice, and they appreciate it! &lt;3 &lt;3 </p>",firefox-770;customize;desktop;windows-7;feature-request;,firefox,customize,en-US,1321030;,darkkenchi,true,fredmcd-hotmail,1

It outputs in the millivolt range. </p><p>This was driving me crazy, until I diagnosed what was causing it. </p><p>Viewing a web page, I'd immediately get FM interference, making the streaming FM audio, raspy and unlistenable, as soon as I clicked the ""reader view"" icon on the toolbar.  Sometimes, I could click the icon again, to revert to the ""normal"" web page view, and the interference would stop.  And clicking the icon to return to ""reader view"" again, the sound was O.K. </p><p>Other times, I'd have to close the tab entirely (which stopped the interference) allowing the streaming audio on the other tab to continue without interference.  I could then open the tab on the ""offending"" site again, and the audio was O.K.  I'd just continue with this tab in ""normal"" web page view. </p><p>Now, I know there are folks ""out there"", who are just as nerdy as I am, who are curious about how ""reader view"" is causing FM interference.

When I use Google Now to read the news, or search using Google and view the resultant webpages in Firefox, this works well, until pressing the back button in Android to close the browser, the browser always goes back to the open tabs page. One more back press closes the browser and returns to the calling Google app. </p><p>This is fairly recent feature that seems to have arisen, and is not shared by the current Firefox for Android (68.8.1).  </p><p>I have Ublock Origin installed in both versions of Firefox on the Z5.

I'm guessing that the reason that it has not been addressed is that the people responsible for ff android are not seeing it, can't recreate it and assume that the problem is not with the app.  A couple of observations from a long time ff android user. </p><p>The problem is that on some pages (<a href=""http://CNN.COM"" rel=""nofollow"">CNN.COM</a>) is one example, if a link on the main page is tapped, that page loads.  When the user then taps the &lt;back&gt; button to return, ff android <em><strong>always </strong></em>returns to an older cached copy of the same page. </p><p>Trying to figure out what's happening, I finally suspect that the problem is probably because ff android is programmed to always return back to the cached copy of the original page. </p><p>However, some pages such as <a href=""http://CNN.COM"" rel=""nofollow"">CNN.COM</a> load as the user scrolls through the main page.  As a result, <em><strong>a cached copy of current page does not exist</strong></em> since the main page is still loading.  As a result the reader is <em><strong>always </strong></em>returned to an old copy of the main page.  </p><p>The problem is exacerbated in ff android because it is extremely easy to accidentally tap links.  When this happens, the only option for the user is to open the ff menu and tap the &lt;reload&gt; button and wait (a long time when near the bottom of the page) for the current page to reload.  fwiw, <strong>ff has forced me to always use ""load in new tab""</strong> for any links that I do want to visit, since, in that case, the main page is still loaded in it's own tab. </p><p>PLEASE FIX THIS...

1289799,2020-06-05 02:47:15 -0800,2020-06-08T05:08:30Z,TB Local Folders not accepting additional emails,"<p>Earlier this year I migrated my Live Mail under Windows 7 emails to a new Windows 10 desktop with TB as the email client.  I used Import/Export NG to help the process and apart from having to put a lot of effort into organising the Local Folders (called Storage Folders in Live Mail) I was pleased (my only serious grumble is that email account passwords are exposed – why?).  But I now have a significant problem as follows: </p><p>1.  I have set up a Local Folders directory structure that allows me to file emails coming from my Inbox into sensible (for me) topics.  I move emails from my Inbox to these folders using the conventional Mouse Select &gt; Mouse Move action and this normally works OK.  I presume this is correct. </p><p>2.  But two of my Local Folders titled ‘General 1’ and ‘General 2’ are now refusing to accept further emails.  ‘General 2’ contains about 3000 emails and takes 177MB of storage.  If I start TB I can move say 10 emails across from my Inbox, and then say 10 more but then no more are accepted.  It’s as if the destination folder has gone ‘read only’.  If I restart TB again I can move another 20 emails or so (it varies I think) but then the destination folder blocks.  Bizarre and very annoying. </p><p>3.  For clarity ‘General 1’ and ‘General 2’ are children of a parent folder ‘Received’ which itself is a child of TB ’Local Folders’.  What is so bizarre that another folder in the same hierarchy (but which is one level further down) currently contains nearly 7000 emails and occupies 2GB and works really well.  I have tried ‘Repair Folder’ with no effect. </p><p>I can’t see what I am doing wrong and would appreciate advice before I feel forced to buy MS Outlook and re-migrate everything again!  Otherwise TB gives me everything I want and is far better than Live Mail in many respects. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1321217;1321232;1321443;1321455;1321461;1321465;,chrisw.bsg,false,false,6

In other words, where is the ""do not check for updates"" command hidden, or, how else can I shut this thing up?  I have, in the past, liked firefox, but it has, over the last few years, supported less and less of features I use daily, at a minimum, many times/day for most. </p><p>So how do I shut these annoying alerts about an update I have NO intention of installing off?  ""You can't"" is not a valid answer.  Nor is ""just upgrade and lose half of the stuff (again) that you use all the time.""  Sorry if I sound angry, but these constant annoyances (and Thunderbird is doing the same---so same question for it here) are really getting on my nerves. </p><p>I have Firefox almost working the way it should.

When I clicked on ""Recommended extensions may also be found while browsing with FF...."" it took me to a page that didn't have anything about AdBlock. Over an hour later, I ended up right back where I started from.  I'm exhausted and I give up trying to follow links that take me back again and trying to describe how it's taking me round in circles. How do I go back to the old AdBlock? It worked well for me, didn't make me reset every time I open my browser and actually blocked ads. Firefox, Windows 8.1 latest versions. Please reply in simple English I am a senior and techy words just make my head swim.  If someone replies and I don't reply back, it may be that I can't get on the internet, the wifi here is lousy at best and most of the time, not at all. I try to get on the internet several times a day, if someone replies I will reply as soon as I can. Don't give up on me.

For example, if I try to click the maximize button again, the mouse pointer needs to be above and left of the visible button. </p><p>I have turned off Linux desktop features, including window tiling and snapping, edge resistance, and some others, but I see no change.  I also tried the monitor resolution and different desktop themes. </p><p>If this is not a bug, I am hoping I can disable something so that the window returns to its original position after it is unmaximized.  For example, the height of the top border decreases when the window is maximized and increases when unmaximized, so if this is causing the issue, I am happy to disable it. </p><p>In the attached images, the top right of the image is the top right of the desktop.  The first image shows Firefox in the top right corner before maximizing the window, and the second image shows the shifted position after unmaximizing the window.

I work with APIs which in my daily work often return various HTTP errors. These errors also contain a payload which describes the problem in detail. I want to be able to see this payload easily in the browser. Yes, I can use other tools like Postman for this (which I do), but for simple GET requests without special request headers it would be much more practical to just use a browser. </p><p>Currently, when my API opens an error (for example a 400 Bad Request), Firefox decides to just silently go back into the previous page (undos the URL change). If I open the Network tab in the Web Developer view, I can however see the failing response with all of its details. Still, this is too impractical for me. </p><p>BTW, the response contains a custom Content-Type which isn't recognized by Firefox by default. But Firefox isn't downloading the payload as a file (like it would usually do for a successful page load of an unknown Content-Type), it just silently doesn't do anything. I've installed an extension to handle my custom Content-Types (called ""Open in Browser""), but since Firefox isn't attempting to open this one, I can't use it in this case. </p><p>So, how can I force Firefox to stay on that URL and show the response payload in the window?

That required re-installation of Windows 10 and most of my software, including Thunderbird.  Having done so, I find that my inbox is empty of read messages, the sent messages folder only holds messages over a week old, and all my local folders with their stored messages have disappeared.  I can download and reply to emails, but TB is unable to save 'sent' messages to the folder, or draft messages to the 'drafts' folder.  The 'deleted' folder is storing such messages though. 1. How can I recover my previous messages, local folders, and draft messages? 2. How can I save 'sent' messages and draft messages again? </p><p>Back when I used Eudora, I was able to install the program files to a second hard drive (D:/) which I use to store all my working files, periodically updating the drive with new hardware and copying everything across.  That meant that if I did suffer a catastrophic system failure, I did at least have all my Eudor files and folders intact on the second drive.   Thunderbird does not offer you the option of creating the program files folder anywhere but on the C:/ drive, resulting in loss when the system requires repair or updating.  I realise that if I had known the system was going to crash, I might have backed up the profile somewhere safe, but that is hindsight and does not help me now.

But, several years ago, I made the switch to Chrome for various reasons. Recently, I decided to give Firefox another shot after seeing some positivity about it on a social media site. So far, I am really enjoying the experience. I want to use the browser on my mobile device but I really can't. I have the app downloaded and everything. It works fine. But, I am having issues with the font sizes of websites. I have gone through and read how to change the size of the text, but the way to do it does not work for me. For as big as I need the font for reading, it is impractical to change the overall font size of my device. That is why I really like Chrome's mobile browser. It has an option under the accessibility settings for text scaling and allows me to increase the text size in the browser without having to change my entire phone. I have looked through add-ons and there is nothing. I don't mind continuing to use Chrome on my mobile device, but I just wanted to know if I was missing something. </p><p>So, I suppose that brings me to my question: is there a way to change the size of the font on the mobile Firefox browser without changing the font setting on my device? </p>",websites;mobile;,mobile,websites,en-US,"",freakshow3497,false,false,0

Y siempre ha ido fino y buen, con velocidad, sin problemas y con una experiencia superior casi siempre, al resto de navegadores. Pero desde las últimas actualizaciones de Firefox, ésto ha cambiado. Tengo la versión 76.0.1(64 bits). Y llevo mucho mucho tiempo con problemas, que me han cansado y he decidido que hasta aquí he llegado. Tengo instalados además, Chrome y Edge. Chrome me parece pesado, porque abre un montón de procesos que no pido, no necesito y me ralentizan el ordenador. Edge no me gusta. Sí que lo veo ágil y Microsoft le ha lavado la cara mucho. Pero no me gusta, y no me da confianza. Al contrario de Firefox. Pero arrastro los siguientes problemas, para que veáis lo impertinente que soy: 1. Imposibilidad de instalar complementos, como puede ser por ejemplo, el de LetyShop. 2. Muchas veces, la página no carga. Se queda en blanco, intentando acceder, pero nada. La mayoría de las ocasiones, refresco y funciona. Pero, no es lo suyo. 3. No tengo bloqueadores. No tengo anti-pops, salvo los que pueda tener por defecto Firefox. Mi antivirus tampoco los bloquea. Pero muchas páginas me dicen que no pueden abrir ventanas. Son páginas de trabajo (IBM, por ejemplo) donde no creo que haya código malicioso. Y sin embargo, algo impide que Firefox las abra. Antes, era puntual. Ahora es cansino. 4. De vez en cuando, pierdo la sesión abierta. Si. Tengo muchas ventanas. Pero me es imposible recuperarlas porque no funciona el histórico bien, no hay posibilidad de recuperarla entera, y es cansino tener que ir una a una abriendo. Y en la ayuda... bueno. Llamarle ayuda es un decir. Tontería diría yo, porque quien pone esas cosas, lo ha hecho en una versión prehistórica (no coincide a veces ni las opciones del menú que se indica...) y desde luego, no ha probado lo que predica. </p><p>Es una pena. Voy a dar un voto de confianza, porque la verdad, tanto en pc como en el móvil, siempre he usado Firefox. Pero me canso de tanto problema. Espero que esta situación cambie pronto. Mientras, voy a buscar un sustituto, que seguramente será Chrome. </p><p>Un saludo. </p>",other;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1318258;1319551;1319559;,ji.perez.marturet,false,false,2

History problem),"<p>Hi. </p><p>I love Firefox specifically because it lets me use Ctrl+Shift+N, i.e. reopen a closed window. I have this one window with several pinned tabs (Facebook etc.) and a few other open tabs (some reseach, YouTube etc.) where I keep things that I need to return to. I essentially NEVER close this window without reopening it, because it has the most important things I need. Sometimes I open a second/third window to work in (I had an online exam the other day, so I opened that and my materials in a separate window, so I can cycle through them more easily). </p><p>When I open this second window, sometimes I close my main window (it has quite a few tabs so it slows Firefox down). I then always reopen it using Ctrl+Shift+N and never had a problem. Well, I closed it now (then opened one or two other new windows), but when I wanted to reopen my main window back up, it just refused to. It's gone from ""recently closed windows"". Interestingly enough, at least two other windows I closed BEFORE it (one from yesterday, that I did unrelated googling in; the other was closed a couple minutes before the main window, it was an emoticon set that pops up from one forum) were possible to reopen, but not my main window. Now I can reopen just 3 windows, and I don't understand where they are (there used to be up to ~10 or so).  </p><p>I want to know why I was able to reopen windows I closed long ago, but not the most recent one, and whether there is a way to fix this and get the main window back. I have effectively lost ~40 tabs that I had open (some research articles, pinned social media, some stuff I wanted to read etc.) that I can't even reopen unless I find them through my History (and hoo boy, that'd take a while). </p><p>Thanks for any info. Have a nice day. </p><p><br> SOLVED - EDIT: The amount of windows that can be reopened can be fixed as mentioned below. Lost window probably cannot be restored, sadly. EDIT 2: Actually it can be restored! See the answer to find out how.

But this time when Firefox reloaded it upgraded itself and I had no choice. I was a graphic artist for decades, and it makes no sense to have the tabs all the way at the top, because your eye has to jump up to the top, away from the window itself, every time you want to move between tabs. It makes no sense, but so far Firefox has ignored these complaints (I'm not the only one) and has not offered a simple toggle in preferences or somewhere to move the tabs where they should IMO be. </p><p>I seem to have lost the instructions to do my own coding to move the damn things, and I would really appreciate if someone could tell me how I can move them back where they belong. And Firefox, PLEASE. People have been requesting this for several years now that I'm aware of, so PLEASE make this simple change and allow users the choice of how their browser windows should look. </p>",tabs;firefox-720;desktop;mac-os;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1317743;,jmazzeo,false,false,1

I don't know why, but the window seems to have changed in some way.  I do the same thing more or less, but when I change the color and press OK; it remains the same.  My computer expert was stumped as well. </p><p>So I'd like to figure out how to change color of the highlighted sections of an E-mail I choose to change.  What's changed?  The little thumbnails below show the steps I take. </p><p>First I highlight the text i want changed.  The E-mail I received was in 'blue'.  Then the 2nd box tells me to choose a color (which I used to do, except the window looks different).  Then it shows various pallettes to choose from; and in this case I choose ""magenta"" as shown in the last box.  I hit OK, but the highlighted text remains the same.  It used to change when I chose a different color.  What has changed?  Thank you. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1317740;,Trudijane,false,false,1
