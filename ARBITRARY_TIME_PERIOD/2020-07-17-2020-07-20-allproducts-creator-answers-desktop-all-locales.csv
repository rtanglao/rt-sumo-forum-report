To be safe I uninstalled my banking app as soon as this virus hit my browser and wont put it back on until this is rectified. </p><p>I was afraid it would connect with my linked laptop firefox browser, so on my pc I ran Hitman Pro, Malwarebyte, Superantispyware, and finally a Microsoft Safety Scanner MSERT deep scan which came up clean after a 5 hour scan. </p><p>The URL changes with each new page ""wwww1.avantgardemachinesszz.xyz"" or ""phonegiftglobe.xyz"" or ""mobileprizeglobal.xyz"" but it is consistently "".xyz"".

Even though I have manually enabled all credit card , and autofill settings in about://config, and manually added my credit cards to the browser, I still can't autofill even on Shopify checkouts, which are standardised and up to standard. I tend to switch to Chrome in those cases, otherwise, I need to get up, get my wallet and manually type in my credit card number, put it back in my wallet and return my wallet to place. And I need to do that every time I want to buy something online. </p><p>I am interested to hear why is Firefox not prioritising and investing engineering resource into this feature? This has been an ongoing conversation for years, there are dozens of threads and I still can't find clear explanation why is everything else being prioritised while it seems credit card autofill is at the bottom of the backlog. </p><p>Thank you </p>",other;firefox-780;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",dvnitycker,false,false,0

1295526,2020-07-18 23:22:53 -0800,2020-07-18T23:22:53Z,Tabs wont sync automatically,<p>So when I use Firefox on my devices (2 PCs and 2 phones) often I notice that moving from one to another that a lot of tabs (most recent) are not synced. Everything is fine if I manually sync but I don't want to have to do that every time I open a new web address. It says it will sync automatically when I close the browser and I have it set to restore previous sessions so I know the browser is keeping the tab information but sync does not work that way. Am I expecting too much or is this not the way its supposed to work? It honestly feels like the auto sync works to some extent but its only updating/syncing maybe once an hour while I browse. This issue is not not device specific. They all seem to have very slow or bugged sync use where the most recent tabs are not synced unless they have been open for a very long time. </p><p>What are the events that trigger a sync if any and/or can I manually set the frequency at which it auto syncs? I really sucks when I leave a page open at the office for 10 minutes shut down and go home and its not synced. None of these devices have any internet connection issues and everything else seems to work just fine. I am also running the latest as of Friday version of Firefox on all my devices. This has been an issue for me for years. I was finally annoyed enough to look for a solution and found none. So here we are.

Terrible. </p><p>The third image is from Privacy Browser, a very basic and lightweight webkit-based browser.  This is very good, it is only missing video and 3rd-party content that I have chosen to block.  The fourth is from Kiwi Browser, an open-source blink-based browser.  This is excellent, and is what I expect from Firefox Android, which is also a full-weight browser.  Why is Firefox not rendering properly?  Is there something I can do to get proper performance. </p><p>Note:  I have tried multiple blink-based tools (e.g., Bromite, Brave), and all work ok, as do multiple webkit ones (e.g., FOSS browser, yuzu).

It currently isn't doing that. (Example Below) </p><p>4) In the history tab at the top it show a short history of sites I went to before the reinstall but it won't update for new sites.

(And, yes, I know they can each have their colour changed, but each icon remains monochromatic - just the simple vector outline in the one colour). </p><p>If anyone already knows or can work out how to amend TB 78 to use the TB 68 folder pane icons (or any other equally agreeable set) could you please let me know how. Otherwise I will just stay on 68.10 indefinitely. (After all, with 6 plugins and some userChrome.css and about:config tweaks, 68.10 does everything I want with my 6 assorted provider IMAP mail accounts, including syncing the Outlook and Gmail calendars, and has been rock solid, so i have no positive reason to change, and certainly not to put up with what is to me a dull and ugly interface with the move to the monochromatic vector icons.) </p><p>I'm sure it is possible to substitute the old icons in the folder pane, as in Firefox I found and used a set of instructions for userChrome.css and the icon pngs to replace the similar, equally dull and monochromatic vector  bookmark folder icons in post-57 Firefox with the old FF-56 yellow folder pngs. So I'm sure the same can be done here for the folder pane icons. Unfortunately I only know enough to follow such instructions, not to come up with the method myself. </p><p>Thank you to anyone who can help. But please do NOT reply with instructions on how to change the colour of the vector icons - I know, have tried it, the results are not good enough. Or telling me I should just like the vector icons - I do not and will not. The only reply that will answer this question is one with the userChrome.css to override the folder pane vector icons with a set of the old icon pngs. </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1334124;1334253;,DavidGB,false,false,2

Now I cannot find that option to turn it back on. I went to another installation and could not find where I turned it off. This also took away the 3 lines control button at the right. I need my previous and next buttons and they are gone. If I right click on the tool bar area now I get a customize button that opens the options to add buttons to the mail toolbar, it shows up properly while this is open, upon pressing done after changing buttons the toolbar goes away again. Anyone know how to turn this back on. Screen shot attached.
