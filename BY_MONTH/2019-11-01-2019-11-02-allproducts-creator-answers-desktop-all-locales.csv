I have installed Thunderbird and linked it via IMAP to my institutional email. Everything there works great.
Using Provider and Lightning I have successfully integrated my calendar and made it editable. It works perfectly.
</p><p>The problem I now face: I have multiple computers: Desktops at the institution and at home and a laptop. I also run multiple OS - Linux and Windows, dedicated  installations on separate computers.
</p><p>On my laptop running windows I installed Thunderbird and got everything working well. I started building my address book and more. However, I find that, in order to mirror this installation and any changes I make, I'll need to do everything all-over again on each computer. Worse, any changes I make on one computer when it comes to my profile and preferences, will not be shared by the others unless I copy/paste the proper profile file to the proper place.
</p><p>These days we live in the cloud, so, like other email programs, I'm wondering if anyone out there has a way to streamline the profile issue and point Thunderbird to one spot in the cloud where there is one profile and all computers and operating systems share it. I have multiple cloud accounts I could use (google, dropbox, onedrive).
</p><p>Thanks for your help.

</p><p>I checked the FF default profile folder and the sessionstore.js file was completely missing, and the sessionstore-backups folder only had two files (recovery.jsonlz4 &amp; recovery.baklz4) that were both only 2kb in size. I suspected these are simply the empty starting page and using a third party website to inspect the contents trhe suspicion turned out to be correct.
</p><p>So, what I'm wondering is are there any other older backup files saved anywhere in the FF folders that could be used instead? I've had majority of the tabs open for several months so I would be able to scavenge most of what I lost from any older backups. And further, is it possible to recover all those tabs and windows somehow if the only backup files are blank as I discovered? I have not closed FF after relaunching the first time after the crash in order not to create any more blank backups.

I'm now running TB 68.1.2 32 bit and I've checked whether mozilla maintenance service 68.1.2 is also installed and that is ok.
</p><p>When I had TB 60.9.0 installed I got also a number of times the popup warning message (at the moment there is really an update?)
</p><p>I have installed a new version on top of TB 60.9.0 (installed by my reseller on my new pc) but that gave a problem: the new version was installed in parallel beside the old version (maybe because the old version could be 64 bit and the new version was 32 bit?)
I have then removed both versions via control panel and installed the new version again.
</p><p>But I haven't yet a solution for the popup warning message.
</p><p>In my case there is no discrepancy between the showed version in the ""about"" windows and the ""tools-&gt;options-&gt;updates""
the ""updates history"" is empty

</p><p>I asked LG electronics firstly for typed words on firefox preview is black masked. (After finishing a black masked word, If I type press space bar, formal word is shown normally)
</p>
<hr>
<p>Answer from LGE Dev team :
</p><p>Play in the store firefox preview nightly to install.
Firefox, access to <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a>.
You can see the symptoms such as video, input characters from a box google.
</p><p>Depending on the keyboard input shown underlined when characters in the area when removing and underlined often show.
</p><p>By removing its first Korean and English on the keyboard input is underlined ..
</p><p>Remove the problem is underlined in return path the keyboard, and when the showing.
</p><p>Japanese input, in its keyboard input method of showing it underlined the special nature. Input, not a problem occurs in the Japanese in return path.
</p><p>This phenomenon is not come from our LGE keyboard app. When keyboard app (showing typed word after removing underbar) is used, Firefox has a problem.
</p><p>Please contact the app developer.

So now this isn't so much a question as a note on the difficult upgrade experience.

</p><p>Firefox 70 on a Fedora 30/31 KDE machine will freeze the entire machine within minutes (sometimes seconds) of launch.  A hard reboot is usually the only way to reset.  The issue is not associated with any particular URL.
</p><p>The System: 
</p><p>Operating System: Fedora 31 /
KDE Plasma Version: 5.16.5 /
KDE Frameworks Version: 5.61.0 /
Qt Version: 5.12.5 /
Kernel Version: 5.3.7-301.fc31.x86_64 /
OS Type: 64-bit /
Processors: 4 × Intel® Core™ i5-4590 CPU @ 3.30GHz /
Memory: 7.7 GiB of RAM
</p><p>When It Started: 
</p><p>The problem began as soon as Firefox was updated to version 70 on the Fedora 30 installation.  I then upgraded Fedora itself to 31, but the Firefox problem persisted.
</p><p>What I have tried:
</p><p>1. I created a brand new user on the system and ran Firefox from that account.  Problem still exists.
</p><p>2. I launched Firefox from the command line in safe mode. Problem still exists.
</p><pre>   $ firefox -safe-mode
</pre>
<p>3. I launched Firefox with Wayland.  Problem still exists.
</p><pre>   $ /usr/bin/firefox-wayland
</pre>
<p>4. I launched Firefox with X11.  Problem still exists.
</p><pre>   $ /usr/bin/firefox-x11
</pre>
<p><br>
Something odd:
</p><p>The user agent string being presented by Firefox is inaccurate.  It is presenting itself as 
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0
</p><p>And yet this is definitely FF70 on Fedora, as I can attest to, unless I have gone insane and am not realizing it yet.   It particularly troubles me that I have to post this support request from a different browser (so disregard the auto-detected user agent associated with this post).  Oh, the humanity!

On top of this, tabs seem to be controlled by YouTube/Google, since I have 2 Google accounts and try to use them in 2 tabs, these tabs are changing to ONE account, even though I have different content on those accounts. It almost feels like someone at Google is monitoring my activity. I feel this is a major intrusion into my privacy. Therefore, I will contact the EU commission to look into the privacy invasion of Mozilla and YouTube/Google!!!

</p><p>I have a new installation of TB 68.1.2 on a pc running Windows 10 (let's call it PC1) and I am trying to set up an IMAP account on a local mail server.
</p><p>Some background information:  The server accepts TLS connections on standard port 993, using a certificated signed by my own CA, and works flawlessly with other clients. The CA certificate is correctly installed in Thunderbird on PC1, and the IMAP account is created without problems. No antivirus potentially intercepting SSL connections is running. Moreover, another machine (say PC2) with a similar configuration (OS: Win10, TB version: 68.1.0) works correctly.
</p><p>The problem is that whenever TB connects to the server from PC1, a ""Add security exception"" dialog appears, complaining that the certificate is not valid (wrong site). To me the culprit is the string in the text field, which is ""<a href=""http://mail.mydomain.net:993"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.mydomain.net:993</a>"": in fact, if I remove "":993"" from that string TB is able to get the right certificate, but there seems to be no way to make the corrected string permanent, and the only option is to cancel the dialog window, bringing me back to the starting point.
</p><p>Is this some sort of bug, or am I doing something wrong?
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help.
</p><p>PS: the text in the attached images is in italian, which is my native language. ""Sito errato"" stands for ""Wrong site"".

I hope someone can help!  I've tried everything.
</p><p>I’m using a desktop; Dell; newer. Windows 10; 1903; plenty of speed and space left.
No viruses, etc.; have done many scans (malwarebytes, adware, etc.) 
</p><p>For whatever reason (I think I incorrectly shut down Firefox and/or my computer, and that was the beginning of the problem), Firefox is causing lot of issues.
</p><p>Won’t open or close. followed all the advice on this site.
</p><p>Found out on this site to try ending Firefox in task manager; when that didn’t work; went in to and deleted parent.lock from the profile.
</p><p>Then rebooted the computer; still wouldn’t open (or did once, but then had the same problem?)
Tried shutting off the computer and restarting rather than rebooting many times during all this process as well.
</p><p>I followed what someone said about adding the word OLD after places.sqlite.
So in the original profile folder I have:
</p><pre>    places.sqliteOLD
    places.sqlite-shmOLD
    places.sqlite-walOLD
</pre>
<p>that didn’t help things.
Then someone said to add OLD to ‘prefs.js’
</p><p>So I have:
</p><pre>      prefs.jsOLD
      prefs-1jsOLD
      prefs-2.jsOLD
      prefs-3.jsOLD
                  Etc….up to # 9; I have 9 of them
</pre>
<p>That didn’t help.
</p><p>I then saved that original profile to the desktop.
Uninstalled Firefox; and reinstalled it.
</p><p>If you go into profile folder, it shows the original profile(‘default’) and a new one I guess it creates when you reinstall Firefox? (called ’default-release’).
</p><p>I tried opening etc. with that new ‘default-release’ profile. 
Same issues.
Again I went into task manager, to end process (sometimes works for some of the instances; but usually not all?); deleted parent.lock again.
Rebooted.
</p><p>Then I created a brand new profile (without going into Firefox; but following some instructions on how to create a new profile without Firefox being open).
</p><p>I opened Firefox with that brand new profile (it asks me which of the 3 profiles I want to use when I went to open Firefox).
I opened tabs, used it, etc. works ok; …..
</p><p>BUT it won’t close or reopen! So same issues with the brand new profile!
</p><p>The ‘default-release’ profile and the brand new one I created were never changed or touched; never added the word OLD to anything in there; made no changes.
</p><p>So Firefox wouldn’t close; so I had to do all of the above again (try to end task in task manager; delete parent.lock, and reboot).
</p><p>So now I’m at my wits end!!!
</p><p>I can’t find anything left to try.  : (
