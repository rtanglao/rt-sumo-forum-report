I've had the  issue for about a month. I've found it incredibly handy to open the download folder from the drop down menu of the download icon. And that option is not available if the the download fails. Instead, a repeat download icon is displayed. So, I've had to comply and re-start the download every time. 
</p><p>Wondering if the first download was indeed faulty, I navigated to the download folder using Explorer and found the page replicated just fine. But it turns out that the second download screws up my fonts and formatting. This I did not know until today.
</p><p>To see if I could figure out the difference between the first download and the repeat thereof, I created two folders, 'first' and 'second' as sub-folders to the download folder. Because I would overwrite the files with the repeat download, I preserved the first download by moving those files into the first folder. The first folder now contained a .htm file and a files sub-folder. The original download location was empty. I then repeated the download, and found but a single .htm file was downloaded. 
</p><p>When I open the single .htm file, the fonts are messed up as well as the formatting. So, thinking that the second download needed it's _files directory, I copied that back, and sure enough everything looked good again. I also compared the first .htm file with the second, and they are identical.
</p><p>My next test was to copy (not move) the _files folder to preserve it, between the first and second download, then compare them. There are differences! There's an extra .htm file in the first download, that's missing in the second. There's an extra .xht file in the second download that is missing in the first. There's a zero length file in each download with unique names, not in the other: mark1_data exists in the first download; a_data in the second. I assumed that zero length files would be fruitless to test further.
</p><p>I next tried to add the missing .htm file from the first download into the second _files folder. That didn't change my fonts or formatting. I also removed the extra file from the second folder. That didn't change my fonts or formatting either.
</p><p>I'll attach the difference listing between the _files folders. The left side has red highlighting and is against the first _files folder and identifies files present there, but not in the second. The right side has green highlighting and is against the second _files folder and shows files present that are not in the first. I'll also attach a sample of good fonts/formatting from the first download, and bad fonts/formatting from the second.

A few weeks back TB 68.2 interfered with the proper functioning of Lightning, and there were issues whether you use the provider for google calendar or not. 68.2.1 fixed these problems.
Unfortunately with 68.2.2 they've all come back again. It's as though some corrections got missed out.
I have, naturally, been through removing the provider, removing Lightning and putting them back. Lightning is no longer working properly, with or without the provider.

It doesn't give me any indication of this if I don't select a folder, I think the count of unread messages is still displayed properly and gets updated when new messages get moved to the folder, though I don't remember for sure.  The way that I notice that the problem is happening is that as soon as I select any folder, all the messages disappear and then start quickly reappearing, and the status bar at the bottom of Thunderbird indicates that it's downloading i of N messages (at some point it stops saying this, maybe after it has downloaded the message headers, but before it has actually downloaded the messages (I have it configured to download all messages from all folders), and the progress bar at the bottom is still going, it just doesn't say what it's doing).
</p><p>I use Thunderbird with a bunch of different email accounts (all via IMAP), and this problem has only happened with <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> accounts.  I have three <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> accounts, one (call it account A) of which I use more than the others, and that's the one that the problem usually happens with - I don't think it had ever happened with either of the other two, until today when it happend for both account A and one of the other accounts (call it account B).
</p><p>When it happened this time, I tried making a backup copy of one of the MBOX files (in account B) from the Thunderbird profile, before selecting the corresponding folder in Thunderbird (causing it to re-download all the messages).  Then I compared the old MBOX file to the new one.  The new one is actually just two copies of the old one, one after another, identical except that in the second copy, the ""From "" line at the beginning of each message, which seems to be an indication of the time at which the message was downloaded, has the date/time from today in place of whatever it was in the first copy.
</p><p>So then I went and looked at the MBOX file for one of the folders in account A (the account for which I know this problem has happened multiple times), and I found that that MBOX file appears to be *eleven* copies of approximately the same thing, one after another, and in large part they're identical except for the ""From "" lines, but there are some other differences as well, I can't tell what the pattern is.
</p><p>So ... any idea what could be causing this or what I should do to figure it out?
My Thunderbird version is 52.8.0, on Ubuntu 16.04, and I do have some Thunderbird extensions installed (ImportExportTools, Manually sort folders, SmartTemplate4, and IMAP Received Date).

Then deleting the incorrect and inputting the correct PW, then re-typing the original query in the search box. Most annoying. I wanted to check some PW entries, again this brings up the Popup every time! So for 5 PW checks I have to enter the same PW 5 times. In the older system I could list the logins and Passwords with one input of the MP, not now and it takes so loooooooonnnng to do a simple check. Does Lockwise really think I need to enter the same info time after time? I have better things to do with my limited time. Entering the correct PW should be valid for the whole time using FF, Even my Bank is happy with me entering the PW just once.
I am now thinking of going elsewhere, I have used FF for decades, but this latest version has really made me think about changing. I understand there will be a new Edge Chromium out Jan 20th so will wait until then and then decide, unless of course I can revert to the older, more sensible, less time consuming, less frustrating version of Password Manager.

</p><p>Também não funcionou... O thunderbird não da nem um sinal nem chega a abrir não sei o que fazer mais....
</p><p>Enfim já tentei de tudo... Excluir usuários, criar usuários, finalizar processos e tudo mais e nada adiantou.
</p><p>E também já até formatei o PC e fiz reinstalação limpa do Windows 10 PRO original e mesmo assim não adianta parece que nada funciona.
</p>
<h6 id=""w_"">==========================</h6>
<p>Isto aconteceu desde que eu precisei desinstalar o Thunderbird e Mozilla através do programa BCUnistaller.
</p><p>E depois removi todos resíduos da desinstalação e chaves e desde então nunca mais consegui fazer o Mozilla e Thunderbird funcionar.
</p><p>Por favor peço ajuda de alguém - Preciso do Thunderbird e Mozilla pois para mim são os melhores.
</p><p>Obrigado ficarei feliz em ter ajuda.

Ahora puedo hacer lo mismo, voy a la web, seleccionó crear acceso directo, la app Firefox desaparece de la pantalla y aparece el escritorio ( hasta aquí todo normal ), pero el acceso directo no se crea en ninguna de las varias pantallas del escritorio ni en la memoria interna ni en ningún sitio . Luego vuelvo a la app, pulsando sobre su icono, como siempre he hecho, y allí está la web a la que supuestamente se ha creado un acceso directo, pero no se ha creado . Por si acaso he dejado huecos libres en todas las pantallas del escritorio, ocho pantallas .
No le encuentro sentido . He probado con el navegador nativo del Xiaomi, pero este no tiene la opción en los menús de crear accesos directos . No he probado con el Chrome que Google obliga a instalar en Android porque no estoy dispuesto a aceptar sus términos y condiciones, aunque he repasado sus permisos y tiene menos permisos que los que le he dado a Firefox .

Just updated my trusted Thunderbird of many years, to the latest version, via the Linux updates portal, and to my utter dismay the Wallnut 2 Complete Theme is no longer compatible! After searching in Thunderbird Complete Themes for a similar complete theme, there is absolutely nothing that is compatible/suitable for this last version of Thunderbird. The 3 basic default themes are either too hard on the eyes in brightness or too black. While I'm not seeking 50 shades of grey, a light, medium or dark range of 'Default Themes' would have been a more practical set of option, surely. Is there any way that I could tickle the 'Dragons' settings to either get a 'Battleship Grey' complete theme or is it just a case of waiting for a 'Mozillian Magician' to program an updated version of the beautiful Walnut 2 theme? 
BTW, Have A Very Joyful Festive Season to each and everyone of you.

When I use thunderbird in Place1 , the messages are marked like SPAM for the destination address. But if I use the Place 2 ,for the same destination addresses they received as usual,no SPAM.
We use another application to send mails (NO massive.Internal mails) . It uses another Gmail account. In Place 2 we have not problem.But in place 1 , if Thunderbird is closed the destination addres received messages not marked like SPAM, but if thunderbird is open, the destination address received messages like SPAM. ¿¿¿Misterious????
I did this tasks
a) Antivirus checking.NOT issues found
b)Change mail account . The same
c) Use Gmail application. Thunderbird open or closed mesages are sended OK
d) Reset the router. Nothing changed
Tengo una ubicación física con 3 ordenadores. Tengo otra ubicación diferente con 2 ordenadores. En cada PC uso Thunderbird para envíar correos. TODOS USAN LA MISMA CUENTA DE CORREO SALIENTE QUE ES DE GMAIL
Desde ayer a las 6pm  ha pasado algo curioso.
Ubicación 2 , envía mensajes que los destinatarios reciben normalmente
Ubicación 1 , envía mensajes Y LOS DESTINATARIOS LOS RECIBEN COMO SPAM. AUnque he usado otras cuentas, todas de Gmail, los destinatarios reciben como SPAM
EN la ubicación 1 he realizado estas operaciones 
a) volver a configurar la cuenta (no la he borrado previamente). IGUAL
b)Reiniciar el router para ver si era tema de IP o conexión internet. NADA
c) He pasado Antivirus. Nada
d) Tengo una aplicación que envía un mensaje automático -a petición, NO es masivo- con otra cuenta de GMAIL. CURIOSO !!!! SI TENGO ABIERTO EL THUNDERBIRD, ENVIA EL MENSAJE COMO SPAM. Si cierro Thunderbird, envía mensaje NORMAL. Este programa y su cuenta se usa en otras ubicaciones.

Chrome has this very convenient feature that keeps a history item from opening on top of your current page - often you want to compare or add what you saw in history to what you're seeing on the current page without making the current page disappear and having to backpage, thus losing the history page you want displayed at the same time. This seems like an easy enough feature to include that FF is ignoring, like it ignores the longtime request that Firefox enable cut &amp; paste to retain website formatting and functions when pasting into an email (and screenshots don't retain functions like links). If there are enough inconveniences to using FF, people use another browser, and if Chrome and Safari can include such conveniences, so can Firefox.

I am preparing a firefox enterprise installation on windows server 2019 with a special configuration and a preinstalled extension. This is a single installation that will be used by all users accessing the server.
</p><p>Here are the steps I followed:
</p>
<ol><li> I installed firefox: <strong>Firefox_setup_68.1.0-esr.msi</strong>
</li><li> I transferred our <code>policies.json</code> file to <code>C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\distribution</code>
</li><li> I transferred our <code>autoconfig.js</code> file to <code>C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\browser\defaults\preferences</code>
</li><li> I transferred our<code>extName@ourdomain.local.xpi</code> file to <code>C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\browser\extensions</code>.
</li></ol>
<p>By running FireFox, I can see that both the policies and the configurations have been correctly considered, while the extension does not work.
</p><p>After doing various tests I can say that:
</p>
<ul><li> the extension is correctly loaded and enabled, in <code>autoconfig.json</code> there are these directive:
</li></ul>
<pre>   pref(""extensions.autoDisableScopes"", 0);
   pref(""extensions.enabledScopes"", 15);
 
</pre>
<ul><li> the extension is not signed, but in the <code>autoconfig.json</code> file there is the directive:
</li></ul>
<pre>   pref (""xpinstall.signatures.required"", false);
</pre>
<ul><li> trying to install the extension from the Add-ons Manager using the item: <strong>Install Add-on from file ...</strong> It works correctly. Unfortunately I can't use this option, because Extension is installed only for current user.
</li></ul>
<p>So, given that the extension works, what's wrong with the preparation procedure, is the directory wrong or some configuration are missing?
</p><p>Do preinstalled extensions need additional files or a different layout?
</p><p>I also tried without our <code>policies.json</code> file and leaving only the directive that allows xpi file without signature in the <code>autoconfig.json</code> file and autoDisableScopes/enableScopes.
</p><p>Any help will be greatly appreciated, thanks

After updating to version 70.0.1, it is back and is now worse than before. I have tried tweaking other settings in about:config as well but none seems to solve the problem. Can someone kindly help me in this regard? I had to ask this question separately as I did not get any more replies to my update in the original question. Again, please note that only 1080p 60 fps throws up this problem, and not any other quality option (60 fps or otherwise). Moreover, other browsers work fine with all quality options.

My problem with Lockwise is that I cannot search/filter saved logins based on password. Before lockwise, I could enter my Master password ""ONE TIME"" to unlock all passwords and then, use filtering based on the password. This is useful when you use the same password for some of your sites (including but not limited to when you are using a non-domain PC to use multiple web sites controlled by a single domain controller; obviously using the same active-directory password) and you want to filter all of them in the password manager to change them all (well, one by one but still in a filtered list anyway). You support page (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/password-manager-remember-delete-edit-logins?redirectlocale=en-US&amp;redirectslug=manage-logins-firefox-lockwise-desktop"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/password-manager-remember-delete-edit-logins?redirectlocale=en-US&amp;redirectslug=manage-logins-firefox-lockwise-desktop</a>) says that I can but that's not true. It's become ultimately frustrating for me to change  my password  in LockWise in all sites that use it. I have 265 saved logins but the sites I want to change the password of, are around 20-30. Please help me to find a way to do this. Thank you, Fereidoun Sadr

I would like to find out 1) what I'm doing wrong that the method I've tried to disable ETP isn't working (yes, I reload the page every time), and 2) is there an ""about:config"" tweak that will turn off ETP globally, as in across the web, and on every new FF session I start? I really don't care who tracks me, but I do care about a feature that makes browsing more tedious and painful. I am using Chrome and Opera in the interim between discovering this annoying ""enhancement"" and when the FF developers fix it so it can be disabled with one click on a more global and permanent basis. Chrome and Opera don't break websites by default.

At lower video qualities/resolutions the hardware accelerated video decoding of the graphics card was also not kicking in, but in these cases my cpu was still able to cope with the decoding load, so I never noticed the missing hardware acceleration.

Using Linux I did move directory:
</p><pre>${HOME}/.thunderbird
</pre>
<p>towards:
</p><pre> ${HOME}/data/_.thunderbird
</pre>
<p>creating a symbolic link in the filesystem:
</p><pre> .thunderbird → ./data/_.thunderbird
</pre>
<p>The logic was to contain all meaningful program user data in one parent directory data that can be moved between multiple machines. After years did eventually change operating systems. I perceived issues with symbolic links. So I returned directories to the original path. This means: remove the symbolic link and copy the directory within the expected path: ""${HOME}/.thunderbird"". This was done in combination with thunderbird upgrade version 45 to 52. I kept the old directory available to rollback if a severe error was detected.
</p><p>- Problem seen:
After previous changes thunderbird worked without any perceived issues. After much time passed cleansing was done to remove the previous installation data directory: ""${HOME}/data/_.thunderbird"". The problem seen is that removing the old installation affects thunderbird. The new upgraded version show profile data is lost: News-RSS-Feed, localhost offline mail folder [without online account].
</p><p>My investigation showed thunderbird somehow uses two directories at the same time. Some data is writen in the good directory (relative path), some in the old directory. This means my program need both directories to preserve all data.
</p><p>This might be due to some thunderbird components not really using a relative path. As the past use of a symbolic link could gravely confuse and affect a component. So even if the profile directory is copied to a new location, the old path is mysteriously preserved and being partially used [for some data].
</p><p>My request is for technical feedback from an expert. To understand how that could happen. To comprehend how some profile internal data is being stored outside the relative path. Wish to fix the problem and consolidate both directories into one. Might also affect thunderbird as a bugfix; because the use of a symbolic should not affect in this way.

I have the correct gmail config setup for the new account using OAUTH2. I have turned on the Less secure App pref in Gmail. But when thunderbird offers to login to this account, I eventually get to the accept Thunderbird as app gmail page and accept, the connection fails. I do not have this issue with the first gmail account. If I understand correctly, OAUTH2 used a token system to avoid passwords. Is it possible that trying to have 2 OAUTH2 gmail accounts is causing a conflict? 
Any ideas are most welcome

</p><p>p.s. Regarding the version of Firefox I am running, I followed instructions for checking for updates on android firefox.  The way it works is it says there are no updates but it does not say what version I have.  That is an excellent way to minimize exposure to end users what version they are running.  It just makes me wonder why you ask what version I am running, since that information is not available so far as I know.

""Disappears"" = turns white (despite background or other colors) and becomes non-actionable (screen shot attached).
Possible connection: it most often happens during or after using the horrible Blackboard program (web-based version) for my online classes. However, I have seen it happen when Blackboard was not currently in use, and once it happened after a reboot when Blackboard had not been used at all that session.
If I have multiple browser windows open (which is rare--I use tabs), they are all affected at the same time.
If I close Firefox and open it in a new window, the problem exists on the new window too.
When it happens, the only recourse is to reboot my computer entirely.
Aside from changing the auto-download location, I have not customized Firefox and have not installed any plugins. (Some may have been installed automatically such as those for Microsoft Office.)

Sin embargo, hoy luego de 3 meses sin usar mi pc de escritorio, habiendo estando fuera d ela ciudad trabajando con mi celular y computadoras de casa en otras ciudades, me he dado cuenta de lo siguiente:
Cuando quería entrar a facebook, me aparecían guardadas otras cuentas de 2 personas que no conozco,a una de ellas se podía entrar, pues su contraseña estaba guardada.
Cuando quise entrar a cuentas de google, y buscar alguna de mis cuentas, encontré que hay otra cuenta desconocida que tampo es mía, a esa no pude entrar.
La verdad no entiendo como esas cuentas pudiero quedar registradas en mi cuenta de firefox sync. lo unico que s eme ocurre, es que el firefox sync este fallando y enlazando cuentas que no son.
o que algun complemento de firefox hubiera vulnerado esa seguridad.

If I am viewing an image that I want to stay on screen (in my case a chord progression for a musical piece), I can zoom out so that it fits on screen, but if the horizontal width is not maxed out, firefox will force the zoom to fill the screen width, thus clipping the top and bottom of the image. Very annoying.

</p><p>Since a few months ago, Firefox started syncing add-on settings without giving you the option to opt out of it. I'm not talking about syncing the add-ons themselves which is a great thing and also the user can turn it off. I'm talking about add-on settings, syncing of which can be problematic. For example, I have a few website blocker add-ons. I have given these add-ons a list of websites to block on my older son's computer, while I have given them a different list to block on my younger son's computer. This is not viable anymore because Firefox syncs all their settings without asking me. The other problem is that even the disable/enable option of these add-ons are synced, which means that if I have these website blockers enabled on my sons' computers, they are also enabled on my own computer. Consequently, if I disable them on my own computer, they will be disabled on my sons' computers. This is a major issue. I have previously contacted Firefox about this, but I assume it has been lost in the large number feedback that they receive.
</p><p>The blocker add-on was just an example, so please don't offer me solutions for that one add-on. This needs to be fixed for all add-ons.
</p><p>Thank you for reading.

OS is 64-bit but only the 32-bit version of Thunderbird was available for me to download, so that is installed. My profile folder is located in a OneDrive folder, which is synced to my local system (I've used this process for a long while without issue). I created a new profile when I upgraded to 68, because trying to upgrade internally caused problems that I couldn't rectify, so I started over and moved my folders one at a time to the new profile location.
</p><p>The problem: After I've been reading/replying to/deleting emails in my primary IMAP inbox for a little while, Thunderbird will stop responding. The delete button/key stops working, when I switch from one email to another the reading pane does not update, etc. If I switch to another inbox/IMAP account, all is well. It only happens in my primary inbox. I've tried compacting the main inbox, but nothing happens. I have to close and reopen Thunderbird for it to start working again. I keep the inbox clean, either deleting or storing messages into folders, so it's not that the inbox is overloaded with many emails.
</p><p>I'd appreciate any ideas you might have as to why this is occurring, and suggestions on how to eliminate the issue. It's not a huge deal to have to reboot the program periodically, but it is a minor annoyance that indicates something is amiss.

However, the response did not solve my problem, which I do not blame anyone for. I would like to provide some more information which might contribute to a solution:
Earlier this year as the result of an IMAP server problem, I lost some mail that should have been saved in local folders but weren't. 
I have used TB for many years but due to my unfamiliarity with directories and file structures, I subsequently relied on the services of an online IT expert to help retrieving the mail from a previously saved profile.
Somehow he copied and pasted the folders and data into the directory Mail/Local Folder/Archive.sbd/TEMP.sbd. Archive and TEMP folders both contain the same .msf folders, which is a bit weird!
However, while whatever he did works on the ""old"" laptop, it doesn't work on the new.
I can see the TEMP folder and data in the profile copied to the new TB installation, and the conundrum now is to figure out how to open it in TB on the new laptop?
I tried to upload a screenshot of the relevant directory and .msf files, unfortunately the process is very slow, so I have abandoned the idea for now. 
Can anyone else offer some guidance?

Welcome to anonymous:-
</p><p><br>
So you want to join Anonymous? -
You can not join Anonymous. Anonymous is not an organization. It is not a club, a party or even a movement. There is no charter, no manifest, no membership fees.
</p><p>All we are is people who travel a short distance together -- much like commuters who meet in a bus or tram: For a brief period of time we have the same route, share a common goal, purpose or dislike. And on this journey together, we may well change the world.
</p><p>Nobody could say: you are in, or you are out. Do you still want to join Anonymous? Well, you are in if you want to.
</p><p>How to get in contact with others? -
Anonymous has no centralized infrastructure. We use existing facilities of the Internet, especially social networks, and we are ready to hop on to the next one if this one seems compromised, is under attack, or starts to bore us. Look for terms like ""anonymous"", ""anonops"" and other keywords that might be connected to our activities.
</p><p>How do I recognize other Anonymous? -
We come from all places of society: We are students, workers, clerks, unemployed; We are young or old, we wear smart clothes or rugs, we are hedonists, ascetics, joy riders or activists. We come from all races, countries and ethnicities. We are many.
We are your neighbours, your co-workers, your hairdressers, your bus drivers and your network administrators. We are the guy on the street with the suitcase and the girl in the bar you are trying to chat up. We are anonymous. Many of us like to wear Guy Fawkes masks on demonstrations. Some of us even show them in their profile pictures in social networks. That helps to recognize each other.
</p><p>Have you been infiltrated? -
If you talk to another Anonymous, you will never know who he is. He may be a hacker, cracker, phisher, agent, spy, provoker -- or just the guy from next door. Or his daughter. It is not illegal to be Anonymous. Nor is it illegal to wear Guy Fawkes masks. Keep that in mind. If you personally have not been involved in illegal activities, you have nothing to worry, no matter whom you talk to; If you have, it is wise not to talk about it. To no one.
</p><p>How do I protect my privacy? -
Invent an alias, a nick, a pseudonym ... call it as you will, just invent something. Then register a mail account in that name with one of the big mail providers. Use this email address to register your Twitter, Facebook, etc. accounts. Make sure to clear all cookies before you start using your new identity, or better use a different web browser for Anonymous than for your other activities.
</p><p>How many Anonymous are there? -
We are more than you think. We are more than anybody thinks. We are many.
And you are now one of us. 
Welcome to Anonymous.
</p><p>We are Anonymous.
We are Legion.
We do not forgive.
We do not forget.
Expect us.

At the moment I only see the Thunderbird junk folder and not the Outlook one which has different junk emails in. Is there any way to get this folder synced to Thunderbird?

</p><p>I have recently migrated to Thunderbird from Outlook and am struggling to find an answer to this problem which I'm sure many have encountered over the years. The version of Thunderbird I have to use is quite low (52) due to still using XP.
</p><p>I use Thunderbird for several email addresses, lets say - A@gmail.com and B@gmail.com
</p><p>A@gmail.com is set as my default email address under ""account settings"".
</p><p>1. When I receive an email which contains both A &amp; B email addresses in the ""To"" field (i.e. I receive the same email twice in my inbox) and want to reply specifically using B, there seems no way to tell which email has been received by which email address and it tries to reply from the default A unless I manually select another email address to reply from.
</p><p>In Outlook, it will handle the reply correctly and reply from whichever email address received it.
</p><p>How do I make Thunderbird behave the same way? I have tried adding another identity under A@gmail.com, but all this gives me is the manual option to reply using A or B addresses and doesn't select the correct one automatically.
</p><p>2. If I receive an email on which B@gmail.com has been BCC'd and try to reply, it tries to send the email from my default A. There seems to be no way of knowing by looking at the email which address received it.
</p><p>Again, with Outlook, if I try replying it replies using the same email address it was sent to.
</p><p>So I guess my question is how to easily see which email address received an email if multiple addresses are present on the dist list or if one of my adresses has been BCC'd?
</p><p>Many thanks and sorry for being simple.

<p>Obviously, edit that font-size: 9pt !important; to a value that suits you. I generally use the same point size as was selected in the OS's desktop settings. You can also set the font face here, e.g.
</p><p>/* 
</p><pre>* Make all the default font sizes 9 pt:
*/
</pre>
<ul><li> { 
</li></ul>
<pre>   font-size: 9pt !important; 
   font-family: Arial !important; 
</pre>
<p>}
A similar file named userContent.css in the same chrome folder can be used to set the size of the content of webpages (and of email if used with Thunderbird.)
</p><p>END QUOTE
So wherever your installer dropped Thunderbird is where you need to create ""userChrome.css"" as an ASCII and insert Zenos' code. Thanks, Zenos. Worked like a charm, and enabled my old eyes to actually see the incoming mail! Otherwise, Thunderbird, out!

</p><p>I would like to implement site whitelisting for FLASH but I cannot find the right combination of GPO settings.

- Activate Flash on websites left in ""Not configured""
- Allowed sites , enabled with a couple of domains on it.
- Blocked sites, put * to block all by default.
</p><p>I was expecting that only the two domains listed would be allowed to execute FLASH but the behavior was that for those two domains, the click to play is not shown. For any other site with flash i can simply click on the icon and enable flash for it. :/

</p><p>I’ve switched to Firefox to try and do the right thing by supporting Open Source software but I’m struggling with some basics.  I have an iPad Mini Series 3 128G running IOS 12.4.2 and a Huawei P20 Pro.
</p><p>I seem to be hitting basic problems all over the place at the moment and a couple of hours on various Community help pages isn’t getting me very far.  In no particular order:
</p><p>- default browser: I understand there’s no option to set anything other than Safari on my iPad.  However, on my phone, although I’ve been into Settings / Apps / Default apps and selected Firefox, and although I open the Firefox app (which shows as v68.2.1) my screen layout still has the look and feel of a Chrome browser.  So, 3 vertical dots on my top right screen instead of 3 lines, no Library symbol and a drop down menu off the 3 dots that looks like a Chrome drop down menu
- default location: I’ve changed this to UK but most of the pages still seem to get served with a default ‘en-US’ element in the url rather ‘en-GB’
- bookmarks: simply can’t import them from Chrome to either my iPad or phone.  The tab to do so in Setting that the help pages refer me to simply doesn’t exist (understandable I guess on the phone as it still seems to be mimicking Chrome), less so on the iPad.  (Or is this something that Apple have blocked to try and hamper Firefox take-up?  I have created an account, signed in to it on both devices and sync’d across them, apparently successfully, but there is no option to import my Bookmarks
- Logins: is it possible to import these? I haven’t found anything which suggests that it is
- Pocket: managed to delete it on my iPad, would love to do so on my phone.
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help with this and apologies if I’m missing stuff that’s basic and obvious.

</p><p>This, happily, changed with lockwise (which also solved some problems on my android devices). I was amazed with the fact that the credentials window opened very fast.

I just switched from chrome to Firefox and this problem is causing me a little frustration.
I installed the app a few days ago and after one day I noticed that Facebook was logged out.
when I tried to log in I get an error saying to enable cookies.
So I checked the settings to find that cookies were enabled, so I tried again same result.
I checked the KB and followed the steps to clear history clear cookies, clear cache etc.
Still says cookies are disabled.
I ended up uninstalling and reinstalling and that allowed me to sign in but this afternoon I have found it is doing the same thing again.
and when I went to create an account for this forum I got the same message saying cookies were disabled.
</p><p>I followed the same steps and went over the KB a few more times but no luck in resolving.
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated.

</p><p>They didn't say which old version they detected, but warned of possible security issues.  
I doubt there are any, but I have no way of knowing what stupid things their site maintainers / code may do if they detect a  really old browser.
</p><p>I've read there are other ways to sniff the browser than a few ""general.useragent..."" prefs, but I'm no expert.  Doubt they are, either.
</p><p>They must use a contract vendor to run the site.  It's been &gt;&gt; a month since 1st asked them to tell me what they use to sniff the browser, because it was up to date &amp; ""general.useragent.override"" reflected that.  Generally, their IT dept isn't very helpful.  I had to call them to tell them to upgrade OpenSSL when the big bug surfaced while back, after ~ 90% of financial institutions had upgraded.  They knew nothing of it.  Still waiting for a ""thanks for your help."" 
</p><p>For grins, I entered a science fiction blended UA string just to see what their system would say:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)  Gecko/20100101 Chrome/74.0.3729.169.
Obviously, Chrome doesn't use Gecko engine.
</p><p>So their site didn't complain about outdated browser or screwy UA string.  Their site displayed the same as always.  I purposely mixed &amp; matched the string.  In fact, I didn't change the UA string back to a valid one yet &amp; this site is displaying OK.
</p><p>One issue in using any browser in LInux (as useragent string)  is a very small pool of users, increasing fingerprint ability.
If I found out that most sites (if using desktops) work fine, even if you spoof the OS AND browser, there'd be a much larger group of Windows 10 / Chrome users vs. Linux / Fx users.

</p><p>I note that when Thunderbird 'Delete History' is used, unlike Firefox, that does not include session history.

By doing this, somehow it has 'corrupted' Thunderbird. On the very bottom of Thunderbird there is a narrow horizontal bar window and when I open Thunderbird it says in this in that window: ""MyEmail@MyISP.com: connected to <a href=""http://MyISP.com"" rel=""nofollow"">MyISP.com</a>"" . And when I try to get Email by clicking ""Get Messages"" button at the top left an error message box pops up saying ""An error occurred with the POP3 mail server. Mail server <a href=""http://mail.MyISP.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.MyISP.com</a> responded:"" I know there's knowing wrong with my ISP Email servers since I can log in through a web browser. I tried restarting my computer but to no avail. I'm thinking I just have to re-install Thunderbird and go through the re-entering of all those 'outgoing/incoming' settings, because it seems like something has been 'switched' indirectly that won't reset from just trying to enter a password.  But I'm hoping I can just do something else more simpler to reset/clear up the issue. I hadn't gone into settings or anything which is why I know entering and re-entering the wrong password is what tripped up Thunderbird to begin with. Thanks.

I'm a long time user of Thunderbird. Because important servers Quotas and bad habbits, I accumulated about 16000 emails, for something like 4 Go. Time to do some archiving. I read the doscumentation and started the process to archive to local archive folder (subdivided by years and subfolders). However it didn't worked as expected.

</p><p>I have two issues:
1) TB keeps redowloading from IMAP server archived or deleted messages just after the action (when I work on batches ; works well with individual emails,
2) In first  attempts, using the "" batch"" archive button, not all emails arrived in my local archive folders (only 20%).
</p><p>What would be the best strategy:
- remove the synchronization to my computer, and do all movements/Archiving/deletion of emails, then re-set the synchronization ?
- reverse: synchronize, go to offline mode, do all the cleaning locally, and then re-go to online and resynchronize ?
- as now, having the synchronization to my computer set, but having a different workflow ?
</p><p>Which best practices would you propose for this big cleaning ?
</p><p>Any explanation about the immedaire redownload of the emails deleted using TB (big batch delete ?)

<p>2) Downloading file should also have copy link option in download tab. Also Download manager should also improve. Like parallel download speed boosting etc 
3) Google site is having some issue, especially stock/share market chart's and dictionary 
4) Indicator is needed to know that particular add-on/extention is working in particular website. 
5) Search suggestions should be vertical instead of horizontal. 
6) Home tab needs to improve, User Experience is quite old now. 
7) Add-on should mentioned that it can be used for mobile also. Many extention doesn't works in Mobile version but are still downloadable.
</p><pre>8) Proper Inbuilt website translation tool needed, add-on doesn't works in Mobile version.

<p>9) More fluidness for Phones with Snapdragon 855 chip.

</p><p>I'm still using an older version of firefox to keep essential add-ons that Quantum no longer had.  I'm having problems on a windows 7 computer with the version I have on it, and would like advice on the best way to proceed.  
</p><p>I had copied over my profile from a different computer where I'd been using FF55.  I'd had some problems with 55, so I installed 52 on this computer, but using that profile.  It's not working very well as I can't get vertical tabs or vertical tabs reloaded to work, it's also crashing fairly often for no apparent reason, etc.  Now even the ""+"" symbol to add a new tab has disappeared from the tab bar, and I don't have a clue why or how to get it back!).  For what it's worth, this isn't a malware/virus problem - I'm running McAfee and also periodically malwarebytes etc., and scans aren't finding problems. Computer has been restarted several times and so on, and I'm still having the problems.  Could this be because the profile was from a firefox 55 version and it's being used on a FF52 version? Or would that not cause this sort of problem?
</p><p>I don't want to go to 56 because I gather it won't be able to access my older saved sessions (I use Session Manager and those are the sessions I'm concerned about - so if this is NOT a problem, please let me know).  I'm concerned about this because wiki says:  ""...Another change was the introduction of the mozlz4 format, a proprietary variant of the lz4 compression format (.mozlz4 and .jsonlz4 file extensions instead of .json.lz4 as per unix/linux standard). Session data is stored in the lz4 format instead of plain text. Firefox 56 can not recognize the legacy plain text session files, only the lz4-encoded ones....""
</p><p>So I'm wondering if I should go to 55 on this computer, or 52ESR?  I gather the ESR would have better security - but want to know if there's a difference in add-on compatibility or other features since 52ESR is, I gather, based on older code than 55?
</p><p>If someone could talk me thru the pros and cons of using 55 versus 52ESR I'd sure appreciate it!!!
</p><p>Also, I would be VERY grateful if folks could point me towards:
1. a reasonably safe site where we can search and install legacy add-ons
2. any webpage which has a good information showing which legacy add-ons now have reasonable replacements in the current FF version.

The same detail is also displayed when I click on the header of the email from the local playhouse.

I noticed this issue quite a few times: When I open the cookies privacy settings, the two buttons ""Clear Data"" and ""Manage Data"" often appear grayed out.
I don't use private browsing or disabled offline cache like I saw in other threads, and I use only 4 regular extensions.
The funny thing is that the buttons become functional on their own after a couple of minutes if I just leave the tab open.
So it seems that Firefox is running some very long process before enabling these buttons the first time the settings page is opened.
If I close the privacy settings tab and open it again, then these two buttons immediately appear enabled, not grayed out.
</p><p>Firefox should probably change the very confusing and counter-intuitive way it is handling these two buttons, or at least display some animated icon to indicate it is doing some stuff, but if it's reading all cookies before deciding to enable the two buttons (and I don't think I have an unusual number of cookies), I'd rather have Firefox enable these buttons immediately and run this cookies analysis process AFTER I click on one of these two buttons, not before.

But, as described, Lockwise is only poorly readible. How can I sync passwords and get the option for the old password interface?

</p><p>The quick solution (for me) was to exit Thunderbird
Backup C:\Users\Bazza\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird (which does not hold my actual profile, only the necessary basics such as profiles.ini and installs.ini [I also backed up my actual profile folder (located on D:\....) for safety]
Restart Thunderbird
Create a new profile via the afore-mentioned dialogue (in my case, to be safe, I used a guff email account)
Update Thunderbird to 68.2.2 again
Close Thunderbird
Delete the new profile information just created at C:\Users\Bazza\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird
Reinstate the backup that I made above of  C:\Users\Bazza\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird
</p><p>For info, this was all on Win7(x86) machine
</p><p>The concern I have about this is that this warning dialogue was given when I had only moved from 68.2.1 to 68.2.2.  Now, I may be wrong, but I rather suspect that profile changes (as referred to in the warning dialogue) are not that likely to happen for sub-sub-version increments (if at all?). After all, the message does state “Thunderbird may have made changes....”
</p><p>Given the above I can envisage quite a number of situations where unsophisticated users may roll back (probably most often using Windows System Restore – although, somewhat surprisingly, I see Win10 has System Restore disabled by default) and then get the warning dialogue and not know how to retrieve the situation (by either using something similar to my own method or by using Profile Manager).
</p><p>Whilst not a complete solution, might it be possible for Thunderbird to keep a track of when version updates actually deliver profile changes and thereby only issue the warning dialogue when really necessary?

</p><p>In earlier versions of Lightning (maybe as recently as a month or two ago), I was able to use the Mini-Month in the Calendar Pane to navigate easily to dates not adjacent to the displayed month or year.  As I recall, clicking on the month name in the Mini-Month would drop down a list of months; clicking on the year would drop down a list of years.  This feature is no longer available.
</p><p>The Mini-Month has buttons “One Month Back”, “One Month Forward”, “One Year Back”, “One Year Forward”, and “Go to Today”, but these are much more cumbersome for navigation than the previously-available dropdowns.
</p><p>Here are my questions:
</p><p>1.	Is the removal of the month and year dropdowns from the Mini-Month a feature, a bug, a problem with my Thunderbird installation/configuration, or something else?
2.	Is there still a way to navigate to a non-adjacent month or year other than one month or year at a time?

</p><p>Back in 2015, Mozilla destroyed the search bar by removing the text labels, making it almost impossible to search because you can't find the engine you want. They also removed the ability to switch engines, meaning you have to nominate your engine every single time you search.
</p><p>On top of this, Mozilla reversed the order you do things: It used to be that first you chose the type of content you wanted, then you thought about your exact query. But now, you first have to specify your exact query and THEN think about the type of content you want to search for, which is totally counter-intuitive and terrible interface design. It's like being asked for the name of the meal, movie or book you want, before you've even decided whether you want a meal, movie or book!
</p><p>The reason Mozilla gave for these awful changes was to ""make searching faster"", but that simply is not the case. The new search bar requires just as many clicks, yet it's drastically slower to use as it's almost impossible to find the engine you're looking for from all the unlabeled engines. Plus, having to type your query first is completely counterintuitive to the user's thought process and slows things down even further.
</p><p>Solution:
</p><p>For a couple of years, Classic Theme Restorer was the perfect solution, bringing back the old bar exactly as it should be. However, since Firefox Quantum, Classic Theme Restorer doesn't work, so I've been using Jefferson Scher's excellent userchrome script. (Thank you Mr Scher!)
</p><p>Sadly, with Firefox 70, the script seems to be broken again and many of the engines are missing from the list. I've tried taking the script directly from Jefferson Scher's website, but doing so just makes text labels disappear. It just seems to be broken again.

It is a good system as designed - but I found that one of my W10 PCs had only two backups, and all of them had huge gaps in the saved-bookmark dates. A few sequential, then a gap of weeks or months and another set - but hardly any more than two days in a row. And old backups are pretty useless to me.
This is odd because have been I using FF as my main browser for a while now - I would expect consistent backing up every day.
So why are the backups so unreliable? Is there anything I can do to make sure FF backs up every day (like it is supposed to!) ? My FF installs are kept up to date. 
It is a worry, any suggestions/explanations most welcome!

""Using an older version of Firefox can corrupt bookmarks and browsing history already saved to an existing Firefox profile. To protect your information, create a new profile for this installation of Firefox.""
Because I am forced to create a new profile I can´t access the original profile with the certificate I need. 
I tried going to about:profiles and setting as default to no avail several times.
I have tried the firefox.exe -P command as well. 
I can´t import the cert9.db file to the certificates setting. I also tried moving the cert9 file to another profile while Firefox is closed but I because I must create a new profile when I open it again and can´t switch profiles once its open it doesn´t make a difference. I´m running out of ideas and it was such a hassle to get the certificate in the first place I can´t afford to lose it. 
Is there another way around creating a new profile? Or anything I´m not considering?

Example: There is a page with ""login"" and ""password"". I have two accounts for this page. I click into ""login"" and both login-names are offered by firefox. I select one account. Now I'd expect that the password is filled automatically. But it isn't. Even if I click also into the ""password"" field. The same with pages where I have only one account.
</p><p>I found some threads where key3.db is mentioned. I searched in my profile folder and didn't find a key3.db but a key4.db. I created a copy of key4.db and named it key3.db. No success.

</p><p>Finally decided to make a topic about it as all of my attempts in the past few months to fix it have been in vain.
Starting from Firefox 69.0 or even perhaps in 68.0, I cannot exactly remember, Firefox started to randomly crash when I opened a New Tab and tried either Googling or opening a webpage through the address bar. This crash does not create any crash reports, going to ""about:crashes"" does not reveal anything, neither are any crash reports stored locally.
</p><p>I have tried running Firefox in safe mode, without extensions, deleting my cache files from APPDATA/Local, deleting my profile files from APPDATA/Roaming and a lot of other stuff I honestly cannot remember anymore, but nothing has helped. I even tried downgrading to 68.0, but I received some kind of big warning message and did not want to proceed.
</p><p>The issue itself in essence is a full freeze, which sometimes takes a second until firefox crashes, but sometimes takes 15 seconds. During that time the only thing I can see in Task Manager is that Firefox has a ""Very High"" power usage, which is bizarre, since I am not even running it on a notebook (i7-9700K factory clock, RTX 2080S, 16GB DDR4 RAM). As said, it never produces a crash report, so I have been reluctant in reporting it in the past. And since it is random and can take many hours to occur (or can occur first thing after I turn on PC and open Firefox), it is basically impossible for me to record a video about it.
</p><p>(While writing this, I went to look something in a new tab, tried opening my Gmail account and the crash occurred. Added a task manager screenshot about what I meant by power usage. Fortunately it allowed me to restore the session and I did not have to re-type the entire text)
</p><p>From what I can gather, the issue started to happen around the time I switched over from GTX 1070 to RTX 2080 SUPER GPU. But I cannot really imagine how a GPU upgrade could influence Firefox stability. Even less so since the same Firefox issue has persevered through multiple GPU driver updates.
</p><p>Hope you guys have some suggestions what to try here. Perhaps some changes in about:config that could help me out here?
</p><p>Thanks in advance,
Rasmus

Now Tbird downloads messages repeatedly. Never happened before. I reinstalled version 68.2.2 of Thunderbird - set account to POP (so that it will not delete emails on computer if I delete them on the server) -which is how I had it before.  Replaced popstate.dat.file. Repaired inbox. No change after a day of trying. It still downloads all messages from the server inbox each time. I also notice that although I have set up filters to sort messages on the inbox these keep disappearing. Either W 10 did Thunderbird in or somehow one or more parts of the system have been corrupted. I have the Thunderbird profile on a separate hard drive as it has been for well over a decade without any issues. I am out of ideas and v frustrated. Help appreciated.

I need to be able to access the same TB profile regardless which of those accounts I use to sign in. 90% of the time I use the general user account to log in but sometimes I have to use the admin login and if I need to send or receive emails using one of my email accounts I don't want to have to log out to switch to the other login. When I set up the computer I installed TB from the admin account so I have not been able to access my emails from the general user account. I also worry about file permissions for the various folders in the TB profile when switching between logins. I think I just have to create a new folder somewhere (Mail most likely) and copy/move everything from the &amp;appdata% folder ""Thunderbird"" to that new folder and make sure the general user account has full control over it and then change the ""local directory"" and/or ""newssrc file"" references in each of the ""server settings"" account options withing TB. Not sure how/when to make those edits and of course what about the PROFILE.INI file?

Did it EVER occur to the Firefox Developers that maybe before you throw up a list of Authenticator Apps that support FireFox, that you first determine if they actually do????????

</p><p>Hi there,
</p><p>Thanks for writing in! I'm sorry to hear about the trouble.
</p><p>I believe this is an issue of your browser blocking multiple download from the same site. I have attempted the bulk downloader myself on Chrome and had success with the bundle you mentioned, so that is the only factor I believe may be holding you back. There is an article regarding this issue for the Firefox browser here:
</p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1163075"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1163075</a>
</p><p>Installing that add-on may help you correctly download the products in question.
</p><p>If you continue having trouble, let me know and I can discuss this issue with my team further. We may not be able to provide an immediate solution, but we can hopefully address this issue in future updates to this feature.
</p><p>Kind regards,
</p><p>-Finn

But it's continuing to find search results which are scrolling. You click on the correct one, but it takes a few seconds to register the click location and by then the message you want has scrolled away and you have to use the arrow keys to scroll to the correct messsage, which itself takes time, as the system is too busy to register the button pressed very quickly. This drives me bonkers!

<p>Funny, so I try downgrading Flash via YUM, which can't be done as Adobe promptly removes old versions from its repos.
OK, so I just YUM erase Flash, only to achieve an INVALID IcedTea plugin. What?
</p><p>Did I perhaps use FF 68.2 for 2 weeks without noticing the issue? Well if that's the case a downgrade to 68.1 will fix things, right?
So I re-add via YUM the latest Flash plugin, but alas 68.1 still thinks that and IcedTea are INVALID.
</p><p>Mumble. Well let me get the big hammer and further downgrade to FF 60.9, remove pluginreg.dat, fire FF up again and... oh. Still INVALID. Now I'm 100% sure there's something weird - but what is it?

I recently got a new system and the local file copied over OK and I was using it.  But I rearranged my storage a bit and wanted to move it.  In the Account Settings for that local folder there is a field for ""Local Directory"", so I foolishly changed it to the new location, assuming the existing file would be moved there.  But instead Thunderbird just made a new empty file there.  Unfortunately I had completely forgotten the old location.  I am assuming (fingers crossed) that the old file is around somewhere and I just need to find it.  But I don't know what file or files to search for.  Is a local folder in .mbox format?  Or does it have one of those bizarre Thunderbird filenames like eiyurwgfoyueg.default?  And once I do find it, how do I get it back into Thunderbird?  I recall there used to be an option to simply open a mail file as a folder but I don't see that option anymore.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

With Javascript, I change divs, tables, &amp;c., from display:none to, e.g., display:block.  All the attributes work EXCEPT the background image.  So, for example, if background color is #000000, the background shows solid black, and if I change that ahead of time or even on the fly to, e.g., #FF0000, the background changes onclick to solid red.  But, the background image appears pretty much at random as the computer pleases.  So, for example, the background-image is set by css for a table where display:none is the setting.  The template changes the table to display:inline-block.  The table appears, the background color appears, but often no background image appears UNLESS I open the console and uncheck, then recheck some property, e.g., height, associated with the background image.  If, however, I set the initial table property to, e.g., display:inline, the initial result shows a bunch of garbage, but once the display is switched to inline-block, all the background images appear normally and regularly.  This appears to be some kind of bug with Firefox, but for the life of me, I cannot fix it.  If the display of an element -- article, div, table -- starts in the css as ""none,"" the background image often does not appear when display is switched on.

How can I continue to use Firefox on company's virtual desktops?,"<p>In my searching, almost everthying I've found related to managing Firefox is from a manual user perspective. Most of our users are not very computer literate to begin with. They are of sort who refer to the browser as ""Google"" or ""MSN"", whichever default search engine they have grown accustomed to, learn just enough to get their job done. That leaves it to IT to preserve their settings.
</p><p>Firefox is writing a majority the user profile information to appdata\roaming. Windows is preventing appdata\roaming from being redirected. This means whenever IT needs to rebuild the desktops, all the users that prefer Firefox as a browser lose their setup. As of yet, we have no specific policy for users creating a Mozilla account to backup their profile to the cloud, but that is a manual process for the users to implement.
</p><p>During the last recomopose, users were dismayed they lost their Firefox settings, especially their bookmarks. The auto export of bookmarks is useless , as it writes its files to appdata\roaming and I can find no setting to redirect that. Being impossible to redirect, appdata\Roaming is destroyed every time a virtual desktop is recomposed. 
</p><p>IT is currently exploring removing Firefox from the next recompose image, because we cannot find a way to support it internally. I am wondering if anyone else out there has Firefox in a VDI environment, and what do you do to preserve the profiles during remaking the desktops?

Mi nombre es Emiliano y tengo un problema (o eso creo yo) con el navegador de Firefox en Android. Intentaré explicarlo de forma simple para que se entienda.
</p><p>Tengo instalado Firefox en mi Android y hace minutos quise entrar a una cuenta de Gmail (desde la pag de Gmail) y para mi sorpresa la cuenta ya estaba guardada en el autocompletar, y no solo esa cuenta sino unas 4 cuentas más de Gmail que son de mi propiedad. 
</p><p>Lo extraño de todo esto es lo siguiente:
</p><p>-No estaba registrado en el navegador Firefox, salvo ahora que me tuve que registrar para hacer esta consulta
</p><p>-Borré el historial y también borré los datos privados, todo desde el navegador Firefox en Android
</p><p>-Chequee en Chrome si tenía alguna cuenta vinculada a Firefox y no hay nada
</p><p>-Dejé la app como si estuviera desde cero, como si estuviera recién instalada, cerré la app y la volví a abrir, entre nuevamente al sitio de Gmail y las cuentas seguían figurando ahí.
</p><p>Así que no entiendo que es lo que pasa, no recuerdo haber dejado esas cuentas registradas en Firefox o algo por el estilo. Me fijé en la sección de ayuda y no encontré una respuesta exacta a mi problema.
</p><p>Lo que me preocupa es el hecho de que esos datos queden en Firefox sin que yo haya querido que queden ahí. Dudo que sea un error de ustedes pero al analizar todos los puntos que les dije anteriormente puede que sea un error del buscador, la verdad no sé. 
</p><p>Me encanta el concepto de Firefox con respecto a la privacidad y en poco tiempo voy a cambiar y a dejar de usar Chrome.
</p><p>Me gustaría conocer una solución a este problema. Estoy dispuesto a contestar cualquier consulta. Espero que me respondan a la brevedad. Desde ya muchas gracias!

3. After about 1 - 2 minutes Firefox starts and everything works OK for the rest of the day. I can start and stop Firefox without any problems.
4. There are no entries in the Win logs that seems related to Firefox. 
5. I have tried most of the tips like refresh, reinstall, etc.  Please note that the problem occurs only once,at  the first start of Firefox after PC power on. Firefox is ver 70.0.1 and Windows is Win 10 pro ver 1809.

Reinstalling or rebooting did not help. From this moment Firefox for Android offered to fill in the passwords from the Lockwise app, but since there were no passwords synced, there were none to fill. So I decided to uninstall the Lockwise app and go back to Google Autofill service for my global Android password management. But in the Firefox for Android app (which I use the most) I still like to use the build-in Firefox Sync autofill feature like I used to before installing the Lockwise app. Firefox for Android does not offer to fill in any password information anymore. When I look in Tools &gt; Logins all my passwords are there, perfectly synced.

Final step was to see if th the FF/sync was working in the new mac and then the number of connected devices to this account: the message I got is that ESR associated but the last time it was active was one month ago. Meaning that ESR lost the ability to sync (w/o any alert) one month ago.

I am an SDET, I am required to automate a test which requires an addon to be installed on firefox browser.
</p><p>Even After setting xpinstall.signatures.required as false, I was not able to load the addon, upon seeing the above thread The possible solution left was to use firefox-developer edition. But I need to mimic the behaviour of addon as an enduser would do. (End users use stable version).
Also, as an automation engineer, I am using an unsigned addon in the staging environment and NOT production environment.
</p><p>So, What is the way to load the unsigned addon in firefox stable (not developer edition) ?

</p><p>Setting the option 'Leave messages on server - For at most [xx] days' does NOT delete the messages from the server older than xx days. I want to remove them ONLY from the server, but keep them in my inbox. It was working like a charm sometime (I used POP mail accounts a long time ago this way), but does not work as expected now. 
</p><p>Please note, that
-- the setting at 'Disk space', which removes old messages BOTH from the server AND from my Inbox is NOT what I want,
-- I do not want to use IMAP on purpose,
-- I do not want to move the messages from Inbox to anywhere else,
-- I tested the behaviour with a Gmail account, and another private email account as well, without success.
</p><p>Remarks:
-- the screenshot is only illustration,
-- tested on Windows 10 Pro Hungarian (but not tested on other language releases),
-- tested on Thunderbird 60.9.0 and 68.2.2.
</p><p>To be exact, the setting 'Leave messages on server - For at most [xx] days' does not have any effect at all, even if clear the checkbox at 'For at most [xx] days'. It's obviously a POP communication bug, even if nobody noticed due to the widespread use of IMAP protocol.
</p><p>Maybe mail providers block the 'DELE' POP commands nowadays? I am totally clueless.
</p><p>Any help or official bug report would be truly appreciated. If you have any questions, or tips, do not hesitate to write -- I am working in IT operations for decades, and ready to test any scenario in virtual environments.

I accepted the upgrade to Thunderbird 60.9.1 just a few weeks ago. In ""About Thunderbird"", the current app says, ""Thunderbird is up to date. You are on the release upgrade channel.""
</p><p>But apparently, there is a Thunderbird 68. It has been out since late August 2019, over three months ago. Thunderbird's update mechanism has told me nothing that I recall about the existence of Thunderbird 68.  I find this surprising. Surely, an update mechanism should have some way of telling me that there is a new major version for me to consider. It might even offer me help making the upgrade (or maybe, migration). 
</p><p>When will Thunderbird 60.9.1 tell me about Thunderbird 68? When will it proactively let me know about the new major version, and point me to information so that I can make an informed upgrade decision?  Should it have already done so?  Since I have heard nothing, should I file a bug report about this?  Should I instead have received an email announcement from the Thunderbird project about Thunderbird 68? 
</p><p>And at what point with my current Thunderbird installation suggest that it is time for me to upgrade?  Will it make this suggestion at some point?  Should it?
</p><p>I am blown away that my current Thunderbird says, ""Thunderbird is up to date""?  It sounds like I am a major version behind!

What striked me as odd is that I cannot stop the thunderbird.exe at all - tried Task Manager, then Process Explorer, also Process Hacker. 
Always had to restart the machine to try something new. 
Copied the whole profile to an old machine and it worked there. Cleaned it up there (remove add-ons), copied it back - opened blank (no emails) in safe mode, but not at all in regular mode.
Noticed that on the initial machine it was version 68, on the old version 60. So uninstalled the 68 and installed 60 after removing data from profile folder. No luck after restart. Still cannot stop thunderbird.exe.
Not sure what else to try.
Wondering if it might have to do with updating my Kaspersky Internet Security. But even after disabling that no success.

From there, I move them to one of the many folders in the STORAGE folder under Local Folders.  That all works fine, except that Local Folders also has subfolders such as Inbox, Drafts, Sent, Archives, Junk, Trash and Output that I don't use.  I can collapse Local Folders, but then Storage disappears until I expand Local Folder again.  That is inconvenient.  So, I would like to separate the Storage folder from Local Folders, but I cannot see a way to do that.  Any suggestions?

How to stop that?,"<p>The History menu, Bookmarks menu, and (obviously) the Bookmarks sidebar have links (obviously). Every time I select one of those links, the web page overwrites the page I am looking at. If I don't remember to make a new tab, I must go back a page, open a new tab, and click the History or Bookmarks link again. I want History and Bookmarks links to ALWAYS open in new tabs. I can find no way to do that. I can find to keyboard shortcut that changes the behavior. Add-ons can do that for in-page links but not within Firefox links. I looked in about:config but found nothing of obvious relevance.
</p><p>Are there Firefox settings, Add-ons, or threats to Mozilla that will address this problem? Am I off track in thinking that this caters to the users of handheld device who lack space for many tabs?

I am running current Firefox on current W10 64bit 1903 desktop PC using Ethernet with Spectrum as my ISP.  I am having a couple of problems in Firefox that are not happening in current Chrome.  1.  Page-not-found 2-8 times a day that resolve every time by simply clicking the ""retry"" (or something close to that) button.   I reset my router to ""factory"" and installed most current router firmware but that did not help.  Netgear Support has been unable to help.  2.  In current LastPass addon, I have to re-login to LastPass every time I start Firefox - did not used to do that (a year ago), and in Chrome or Edge that does not happen.   I have re-installed the LastPass add-on.  I have upgraded Firefox many times and have cleared history/cache many times.  
So now I want to COMPLETELY remove Firefox, reboot,  and then install Firefox from scratch.  Can someone please point me to the web page that tells me how to properly remove all of Firefox so that I can re-download/install it from the beginning?  I do not care about retaining my Firefox settings or other from my current Firefox install.

</p><p>La única diferencia entre uno y el otro es que uno ejecuta el perfil home y el otro ejecuta el perfil work y cada uno tiene sus menus contextuales para gnome por separado para cada perfil.
</p><p>Entonces, desde el menú de gnome3 he agregado ambos accesos de firefox y funcionan muy bien, cuando hago click sobre el ícono firefox home inicia firefox con el perfil personal y cuando hago click a firefox work me aparece el perfil de trabaj con las pestañas, archivos y accesos del trabajo.
</p><p>El problema es que cuando inicio firefox este no mantiene el contexto de ejecución de la aplicación en el ícono de gnome, se crea un tercer ícono de firefox en el menú lateral y cuando inicio los dos perfiles estos se mezclan en este mismo tercer ícono.
</p><p>¿Porqué sucede esto?, ¿Cómo puedo hacer para que la ejecución de firefox quede asociada al ícono que lo ejecuta solamente?
</p><p>Por otro lado, no sería mala idea que Firefox pudiera utilizar de manera mas cómoda los perfiles y poder intercambiar entre uno y otro. Antiguamente usaba los grupos de pestaña para englobar mis pestañas del trabajo y los personales, pero desde que los eliminaron que he tenido que mezclar todo y uso muchas pestañas y se me hace un desorden, los grupos de pestaña eran una genialidad y me ayudaba a ordenar y separar todo. Así como lo hace Android por ejemplo que es capaz de mantener perfiles de trabajo y separar la ejecución de una misma app en dos contextos (trabajo y personal) en dos iconos separados (uno con una insignia de maletín), asi mismo sería genial que firefox tuviera la posibilidad de crear perfiles dentro del mismo navegador y poder acceder a estos perfiles a traves de accesos directos diferentes con insignias definidas por el usuario, talves de una lista pequeña de insignias que sean nativas de firefox, asi podriamos tener perfiles de pentetsing, desarrollo, personal, trabajo, etc. Me dirás ¿porqué no hacer todo eso en un mismo perfil?: porque por ejemplo para desarrollo uso github, para el trabajo tambien y cada ves que trabajo debo cambiar de cuenta, estar cerrando sesion y luego a la noche estar volviendo a iniciar sesion con mis cuentas personales, algo similar le pasa a la gente que usa facebook web de manera personal y para sus pequeñas empresas, por ejemplo conozco a gente que debe usar chrome y firefox al mismo tiempo para poder usar dos perfiles de facebook a la ves.

</p><p>As of version 69 Mozilla Firefox no longer auto searches for custom scripts IE: userChrome.css (see below for more info) that reduce the width of the address bar once placed in the Firefox <em>Profile</em> folder. In order to do that create a Folder named <em>chrome</em> on the desktop. Step two: Create a .TXT file, rename the Extention from <em>.txt</em> to <em>css</em> rename it <em>userChrome.css"" and place into the </em>Profile<em> folder with the following Code 
</em>
</p>
<pre>@namespace url(""<a href=""http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul</a>""); /* numbers are adjustable */

#urlbar-container { max-width: 400px !important; }

#search-container { max-width: 200px !important; }</pre>
<p>In order to Locate the folder, 
If your Firefox was installed by .EXE file the <em>Profiles"" folder will not the Program Files Folder (In order to locate it 1. Hit the Windows button Lower left 2. Hit </em>This PC<em> 3. Locate C Drive 4. Go to Users, Find the name you named your PC 4. AppData 5. Roaming 6. Mozilla 7. Firefox 8. Profiles) unless you are using the </em>Portable version"" in which case the <em>Profile</em> folder is in the <em>Data</em> Folder.   Or just search for <em>Mozilla"" to find the Data folder from there, then open the Profile folder. 
</em>
</p><p>The scripts still works, again as mentioned on the 1st line of this post, As of version 69 Mozilla Firefox no longer auto searches for custom scripts IE: userChrome.css. So you will have to enable it to do so, or it won't work. In order to do that 
(1) Open a new tab, type or paste about:config in the address bar and press Enter/Return. Click the button accepting the risk.
(2) In the search box above the list, type or paste the word <em>userprof</em> if it's disabled, double click it to enable it. 
(3) In the search box above the list, search for <em>toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets</em> preference is not already set to true, double-click it to switch the value from false to true.
</p><p>(4) Close Mozilla Firefox 
(5) Insert the <em>chrome</em> folder you created it into the Firefox Profile folder (Tips on how to find that folder, above).
(6) Insert the userChrome.css file with the code in it (Instructions above) into the chrome folder in Profile folder. 
(7) Open Firefox.
</p><p>Sidenotes. The numbers located in the userChrome.css file are adjustable. If your URL/Adress Bar are too long or short,
lower the number incrementally to suite your preference. This is a working Tutorial as of Firefox 70.0.01

This is happening on my Win10 machine - my Win7 box is not having any issues since the update.
</p><p>I have followed the advice of creating new profiles, checking for locked profiles (and being unable to remove the lock?).  I have completely removed Firefox from my system - uninstalled via control panel, deleted all folders in Program Files and Users etc, removed temp files and edited the registry to completely remove any Mozilla/Firefox entries.  Completely clean install - as far as I can tell - but the problem re-appears as soon as Firefox is reinstalled.  I've tried all this in WIn10 safe mode as well but still no joy.
</p><p>The issue seems to be that there is a process running that cannot be terminated but I'm unable to kill the single remaining Firefox.exe process listed in task manager.  When I try 'taskkilll /IM firefox.exe /F' from the command prompt I get an error that the process can't be killed as an instance of it does not exist.  If I try 'taskkill /IM firefox.exe /T /F' it advises that a child process is keeping the main process alive - explorer.exe.  Terminating explorer.exe does not free up the firefox.exe process for termination (same error of the instance not existing).  The only way to clear the process is to reboot my system, Firefox will then start ok but when closed the issue will occur again.
</p><p>I'm on my 4th clean install and the issue persists, so any help or advice beyond what I've tried would be appreciated.

Do you have Android app to read RSS on smartphone, synchronized with PC Thunderbird? Are you going to write it? I'm going to do it myself. It will also be open source: mobile app and synchronization program for PC, synchronization will be offline (USB, Bluetooth, WiFi Direct) and online (encrypted, using my site's server or P2P). But if you are working on it, it's not needed.

It was possible to solve the problem if you delete the contents from Mozilla \ Firefox \ Profiles \ l5jq850f.default-release \ storage \ default. but then all plugin settings are lost.

""Did Not Connect: Potential Security Issue
Firefox detected an issue and did not continue to <a href=""http://gate.starislandgames.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gate.starislandgames.com</a>. The website is either misconfigured or your computer clock is set to the wrong time.
It’s likely the website’s certificate is expired, which prevents Firefox from connecting securely. If you visit this site, attackers could try to steal information like your passwords, emails, or credit card details.
What can you do about it?
Your computer clock is set to 11/8/2019. Make sure your computer is set to the correct date, time, and time zone in your system settings, and then refresh <a href=""http://gate.starislandgames.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gate.starislandgames.com</a>.
</p><pre>If your clock is already set to the right time, the website is likely misconfigured, and there is nothing you can do to resolve the issue. You can notify the website’s administrator about the problem.""
</pre>
<p>This has NEVER happened before. Some of those also don't work/function on Chrome. It obviously isn't my clock, it's either Facebook &amp; other sites running the videos &amp; games or a certain site running them. The first sentence said (after the Did Not Connect part) makes it sound like YOU/Mozilla stopped it from working or going to the site, even though it's clearly the site itself that doesn't work in general (maybe from that expired certificate, NOT because it's an hour off LOL, OR they got attacked with malware like some others in past months). At least I know it's not just me that can't use those apps for now.

I have a Lenovo Yoga Book laptop-tablet, hybrid computer with Android.
Everything works well, but in my old laptop with Windows and Linux Ubuntu, I could watch and listen to one video and listen to another video, that is hidden (opened on a diffrent page).
Unfotunately I can't do that on Android.
Strange thing is, that I can listen to the video, that is hidden (opened on a diffrent page)
but only, when I turn off the sound of the video I am watching watch.
The other strange thing is that one I was able to to watch and listen to a video and listen to the sound of another video, opened on diffrent page. So, it looks like, this is technically possible.
I tried Android settings (including desktop options settings,) and my browsers settings, but nothing works. However, I might have missed something.
I need to watch and listen to a video, and listen to another one, with music at the same time;  it helps me in the learning of a language.
Maybe you know, some good software app or browsers, that can solve this problem?
Currently, I use FireFox Beta, FireFox and Chrome browsers.
</p><p>I have also a question about subtitles, is there any app or browser that can offer good translation, when a video on youtube, does not have translation options?
Could you also tell me please, what may be a reason, that I watched a youtube video, that had translation option and now, this video doesn't have any translation option? Is there any way to solve this problem?
</p><p>Thank you very much for helping me.

</p><p>I would be happy for it to automatically install the update on next restart. I will tolerate nag screens to remind me to restart the browser as soon as is practical. I *cannot* tolerate it absolutely ruining what I was doing by suddenly showing a demand to restart instead of the page I just submitted, or having something half written I need to check something for in another tab to find that I cannot do that and so cannot finish what I was doing before restarting.
</p><p>This update process is hostile, and disabling updates entirely is not at all what I want to do, I just want to control where my workflow is interrupted and avoid LOSS of work. But I can only seem to find the extreme options of no updates at all, or automatic updates that will randomly ruin what I am doing.
</p><p>If this is the new reality for Firefox I'll have to find something else to use, but having spent several hours trying to find a fix for this - and this not being the first time I looked as this has impacted me several times previously - even if there is a workaround it's incredibly poor form to not allow this option in a simple manner or to have such information easy to find.

</p><p>When I click on the ""Get Messages""-button (Authetication method set to ""Password form fill in the background"") I get a prompt saying ""Could not detect login form"" at the bottom of the window.
If I, instead, have the account server settings &gt; Security Settings, Authentication method: ""Open login web page"" set up and restart Thunderbird, the Outlook login-page pops up in another tab shortly and it seems to log me in as intended before closing the tab - although, this is a very quick process, which makes it hard to discern if something seems off.
After this, I will instead get the prompt ""Login expired. Please log in to your account and try again.""
I am able to log in on this mail through both Outlook and Gmail, where I can still receive and send messages.
</p><p>The gmail-address, however, works just fine.

I am trying to find the history of a specific URL, like the last time I opened it yesterday, but it seems that the most information History records or shows is the last time I opened it (today) and the total number of times I accessed this URL (4). I can't find any actual history of this URL in the History library. Am I missing something, or does the History feature record only the last access?
This would be very bad and a far cry from any kind of history.
Also, the Search feature does not seem to take into account the range of dates selected in the left pane. For instance, if I select ""September"" and search for my URL, it returns the URL that I accessed in November and that didn't even exist in September. The Search feature could be a little more contextual, and work on the whole history only if the root ""History"" folder is selected. But that's aside the main question, how to find the full history of a specific URL, not just its last access time.
Thanks.

- Second solution use normal password with a app password newly created for that. This does not work too and no usage of this app password found on my account.
- I can't make my account accept less secure app because I'm not able to disable OAuth due to company auth policies.

If I try to access Hotmail again via <a href=""http://hotmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">hotmail.com</a> or <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> again, I get stuck in that page; I can't even get to the sign-in page.
</p><p>Interestingly, I don't experience this problem at all using the other browsers on my PC -- Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Edge.  I also don't experience it using the Firefox app on my Android phone.  It occurs only when I use Firefox on my PC.  Does anyone know how to resolve this problem?

I tried the device management in my account page, but I can't see anything on my new PC except itself, meanwhile I can see my old PC and iPhone itself on my iOS Firefox. I tried to re-sign in on my iPhone, and shockingly found that I can only use my old password to successfully sign in, the new password working on my new PC is a wrong one for my phone.
Then I tried to delete the account with new password on PC. After delete successful, sign in on my PC with that E-mail was correctly reported as ""unknown account"", but I can still sign in with the exact same E-mail and the old password on my phone, like nothing happened at all. At the same time, even if I tried the exact same combination of E-mail and old password on PC, the result is always ""unknown account"", like it already be deleted.

I personally just use webmail for everything. My Customers use Outlook. This one, however, used Thunderbird. Customer had a <a href=""http://verizon.net"" rel=""nofollow"">verizon.net</a> email address configured as pop in Thunderbird. ALL of his emails are automatically deleted from the server after Thunderbird downloads a copy. He has nothing in Inbox and is in excess of 15 directories in his Local folders (some with subdirectories) with all of his emails. Pretty much everything that went into his <a href=""http://verizon.net"" rel=""nofollow"">verizon.net</a> Inbox was immediately filed away very neatly. He is migrating to an IMAP gmail account, which I set up in Thunderbird. Due to the fact he has such a particular organization, I wanted to bypass the monotony of re-creating all those folders in his gmail to then manually copy over the individual emails. I wanted to just move everything in one fell swoop. After determining that I could not just copy over entire directories from the Local folders into his gmail account inside Thunderbird, and finding some difficulty in exporting an entire mail profile like you would in Outlook, I decided to be clever and messed around in AppData. I found the .msf files in his pop account folder (...thunderbird/profiles/profile/Mail,) then drag+drop moved them to the imap folder (...thunderbird/profiles/profile/ImapMail.) Upon Restarting thunderbird, I was given an error message about the folders not existing in the imap mail, then discover that those .msf files, directories, and emails were completely gone from both accounts. Thunderbird had not rebuilt anything. Long story short, is there any way to recover these items or will I have to use a data recovery program?

</p><p>My first time here, just recently switched from Chrome to Firefox, but seems like it's a bit problematic. 
Version 70.0 worked fine, but ever since 70.0.1, Firefox starts crashing (randomly). 99% of the time there is no error message, the browser just crashes(closes) and that's it, no crash report, no error, the only thing I can do is to restore previous session. Usually, after crashing, it will crash again 2-3 times upon opening the browser, until it will finally work...for a while. 
Rarely there have been errors, saying the same thing - memory could not be read (attached in the post). Does not happen with any other browsers. All my drivers and software are up to date, memory is OK, (did windows memory diag and memtest86), hardware is okay, tried disabling plugins and hardware acceleration, still nothing. All that ever since 70.0.1, before that it worked fine. Is it just me or anyone else having that problem? 
If any additional info is needed, let me know.

</p><p>I do the IT support for my dad (85+ years): 
Firefox 70.0.1 64 bit on Windows 10 Home 64 bit, all up to date.
He has various passwords saved in FF, but I specifically instructed FF to exempt the sites he uses for Online Banking sites from saving passwords. 
</p><pre>  ""Access &amp; Passwords"" &gt; Exceptions: sites listed (entered by clicking ""NEVER save"" when asked on login). 
</pre>
<p>I have FF delete all data upon closure: 
</p><pre>  ""Delete history when FF is closed"" all EXCEPT for ""Website Settings"" (which I learned would also kill the password save barrier)
</pre>
<p>Now, I don't know what my dad does; every time I check after a week these settings are gone and FF is happily back, offering the saved login details to his Online Banking sites, also the Exception list is empty. My dad cannot say what he did to change this and maintains ""he didn't do anything"" (see also: typical IT support customer statements). 
Sometimes I find he has even reinstalled FF for no good reason (which I can see in the Apps bar). But this should not affect the Profile settings, and even if he should have agreed to delete profile data: the bookmarks are still there, so it's not all gone. 
</p><p>For now I have deactivated FF from saving any passwords, which is the safe choice when Online Banking is involved (no, my dad won't agree to close the Online Banking Account altogether go to the bank). But this creates new problems with all the other less sensitive sites where he needs to enter passwords (newspaper sites etc.), which he misplaces and keeps on resetting them (to passwords which he will again not remember the next time round). 
</p><p>My next thought was to set permissions.sqlite to read-only, as I found this is where FF stores the exception list. Unfortunately, I realized that FF apparently updates this file every time it's run and ignores it if it finds it is out of sync with what it expects, returning to the clear sheet. So this doesn't help. 
</p><p>I guess I could set up an autorun batch file to delete the profile directory and restore a golden reference directory, but this could be error-prone too. 
</p><p>So I was wondering if the community can point me to a way to permanently fix a given list of Password-Save-Exceptions which cannot be altered by the user? Something like a config setting, available or hidden? 
</p><p>Thanks for any advice or pointers,

I had inadvertently removed my bookmark webpage star from my browser (Firefox v.70).  I searched and couldn't find an answer as to how to get it back on my address bar.  The closest answer involved clicking the ""Page actions"" (which looks like an ellipses; 3 dots) button which is adjacent to the bookmark webpage star button by default.

Refresh the browser.
Right-click on an empty area of whatever webpage.
A context menu will popup with a star that appears in the upper right side of that popup window.

</p><p>My weekly routine involves adding descriptions to recurring events. Before migrating to Thunderbird/Lightning (Remote Calendar via CalDAV hosting provider) from Outlook (Remote Calendar via Exchange/Office Enterprise), it was the easiest and quickest way to have detailed recurring events: The meeting itself is recurring, and always at the same location, just every week I add a description. The modified event itself was not part of the recurrence anymore, but that was fine.
</p><p>Now, in Thunderbird, I run into this problem: If I have a recurrent event (with time and location set) and modify a single occurrence (adding a description), the modified occurrence will have ""forgotten"" its location. Even worse, while the editing dialog is still open, it will show the location, but when I then save and close it, the location is gone (both in the calendar view, and when I open it again).
</p><p>The problem is appearing using both Lightning CalDAV as well as TbSync CalDAV.
</p><p>If I change the description and the location for a single occurrence, it remembers both correctly.
</p><p>If I use my web-based CalDAV interface from the hosting provider, editing a single occurrence keeps the location, and it also syncs back correctly to Thunderbird.
</p><p>I have tried the same for local calendars and the problem is not appearing in this case.
</p><p>Editing a single event keeps the location information correctly in Thunderbird 60.9.1 (32-bit) / Lightning 6.2.9.1.
</p><p>If I export the local test calendar, which only includes the series as well as the modified event (and appears correctly in Lightning), the .ics file (attached below) does not contain the location information in the modified VEVENT. Importing it (even to another, local test calendar) also does not reload the location from the reoccurring event.
</p><p>I really want to stay with CalDAV and Thunderbird, but this is really annoying. I have a couple of questions therefore on how to mitigate or understand this:
</p><p>1. What is the expected behavior in the CalDAV standard, especially concerning the import/export function?
</p><p>2. Is this the expected Lightning behavior (""forgetting"" the location from the recurring event, even though showing it in the editing dialog initially)?
</p><p>3. Is the import/export problem related to how Lightning/TbSync talk to the CalDAV-server, making the same problem appear in remote calendars?
</p><p>Edit: I reported the bugs: <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1595332"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1595332</a> and <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1595334"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1595334</a>

The message is removed from the folder you drag it from, added to the folder you drag it to. Dragging a message out of an IMAP account and putting it in a local folder or another IMAP account removes it from the original account. This follows the desktop metaphor we've been using ever since the dawn of graphical user interfaces.
</p><p>When I moved my mailbox to GMail, I continued to use Thunderbird manage it, connected by IMAP as before. Everything appeared to work the same way. Dragging a message out of my GMail Inbox to a local folder made it disappear from the Inbox and appear in the local folder. Many many years and hundreds of thousands of messages later, I realize that this has not been happening as I thought. My GMail account is nearly full of messages I thought I moved off GMail but actually only copied out while removing the Inbox tag and leaving them in All Mail. It's so bad that I believe I can write a tool to purge my All Mail of messages that have no tags faster than I can delete them by hand.
</p><p>I read <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1130010"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1130010</a> and was surprised that, at least 3 years ago, the consensus was that you have to delete the message separately, either on the GMail web interface, or by finding the message and deleting it from All Mail.
</p><p>Has there been any update in the last 3 years? How do other people deal with this problem?
</p><p>I would argue that the principle of least astonishment requires that a message moved out of GMail needs to be deleted - tagged as Trash, I suppose - whatever is required to remove it from the GMail account. While as a developer myself, I can understand the point of view that ""if running the same IMAP commands on Google as on any other IMAP server doesn't have the same effect, that's Google's problem,"" I would argue that, no, it's not - Thunderbird needs to present the same effect to the user, even if special case code is required for GMail.
</p><p>Thoughts? Recommendations?

After browsing for a while when I open a new tab and try to load a web page large parts of Firefox become unresponsive, for example I can close other tabs, move tabs, use websites in other Firefox windows largely unaffected but I cannot view other tabs in the window I opened the crashing tab. The unresponsive tab just sits there with a loading animation in the tab name, white screen, what ever website I tried to visit cleared from the address bar.
</p><p>Opening additional tabs is possible but the crashing window will not switch to those tabs, while in another window I can open a new tab but actually visiting a site or opening a link in a new tab will crash that window. 
</p><p>Opening new windows once I'm crashing results in a crashed window regardless if I use the empty page or load a URL.
</p><p>Lastly if I click on a link before a tab crashes nothing will happen. No tab will open, no tabs will crash, the link won't turn purple. But at this point I can go fully about my business reading the existing loaded content in all my working tabs and windows. Opening the link in a new tab with context menus will crash the new tab immediately.
</p><p>Once a tab has crashed I am forced to close the browser. It usually takes a while to fully shutdown, but it's never unresponsive enough to need to be killed in the Task Manager.
</p><p>And sometimes this entire process corrupts my profile and I get to re-login to everything on the web again.
</p><p>Now, here's the frustrating part. I don't know how to troubleshoot this. The issue has persisted through:
- Firefox versions 67, 68, and 70
- My machine was re-imaged with a new Windows image when I was upgraded to an SSD. The previous image didn't have Firefox preinstalled, the new image did(68). I purged that and installed 70 and the issue continues.
- I have disabled hardware acceleration multiple times(because my profile keeps getting reset).
- There are no crash logs.
- I haven't taken to time to reproduce the error with no extensions but I've A/B tested that I can crash running just uBlock or just Tusk. I'm not running a lot of extensions because the profile keeps getting reset.
- Firefox isn't actually crashing, no crash reports are being generated, Windows event log is clean.

</p><p>At this point in time, I have been using Firefox (standard installation) in some kind of black/night/dark mode for a few weeks.
Because the color scheme is not always helpful, some websites are just not able to be navigated and I want to turn it off.
</p><p>For reasons unclear, I cannot.  If I go to Settings Bars (hamburger?)&gt; Options&gt; Colors...
The settings already indicate black text and white background.
</p><p>Uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox changing various choices about (refreshing, or not) has NOT worked.
</p><p>Note:  I am running in a Windows 10 Dark Mode environment ~~~ I don't know if Firefox is merely inheriting that.
Regardless, even installing a dark/night mode extension to place controls in the browser bar does nothing to restore a normal look to Firefox.  By contrast, Chrome allows a toggle switch, per browser window, that allows me to change up the color scheme so I can see important information while searching a give internet page.
</p><p>How do I return to normal Firefox appearance when uninstalls do not correct the problem??
</p><p>Truly Exasperating.

There has GOT to be a better answer. It's been too many years of this making excuses.
</p><p>If nothing else, can't someone develop JUST a rinky dinky program/add-in that loops through all open pages one by one, closing, pausing while we check Taskman, then reopening so we can see the effect? That would be TRIVIAL for someone to write just that crude thing. But it would save people breathtaking amounts of time because we're having to do this manually, over and over and over and over and over. Even with this simple routine, it could be enhanced to record the CPU load from Taskman or TaskInfo or something, since we'd be slowly, ploddingly writing down or pasting the results as I stepped through the pages one by one.
</p><p>Better yet, ideally, just do this, which also should not be technically difficult - seriously. Take some unused field and populate it with identifying information (like the Save As name of the page), then inform Microsoft (for taskman, resmon) and Iars (for TaskInfo) where it is. Or write our own CPU monitor extract just to measure FX CPU, that displays which PID goes with which window)(s).
</p><p>THAT'S WHAT IS DESPERATELY NEEDED. An indication of which browser instances go with which PIDs. Even if there's some overlap, if PID 6632 is using an entire core and more of my desktop, if I can just even partially limit which browser windows are burning there, that would be enormous.
</p>
<pre>For example
PID....FX-ID
15......google.com / (name of page, e.g. ""power supplies - Google Search.htm"")
15......mozilla.com / (name of page, ...
15.....microsoft.com / (name of page, ...
15.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
15.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
15.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
15.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
25......google.com / (name of page, e.g. ""power supplies - Google Search.htm"")
25.....microsoft.com / (name of page, ...
33.....ameritrade.com / (name of page, ...
33.....yahoo.finance / (name of page, ...
33.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
33.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
33.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
33.....youtube.com / (name of page, ...
33.....goduckgo.com / (name of page, ...
etc.</pre>
<p>If the reason no one's done this is because there's more than one page associated with each PID, that's covered in the listing above. Just list what you know, every one of them. Do you see how powerful that would be, if we knew that PID 15 was shredding the CPU, and we could at least limit it to a limited number of possible criminal pages?
</p><p>I keep numerous windows open and like it or not the reality is that one or more of them are running obscenely rude loops to refresh the page or scan for input or whatever. I have a very well equipped desktop but it is hammered by one or more such sites. I and I am sure others have wasted hours and hours and hours hunting and pecking to diagnose this, and there's NO END to it, because there will continue to be piss poor webpages that suck CPU and disk. Even from <a href=""http://microsoft.com"" rel=""nofollow"">microsoft.com</a>, as you surely know to be often the worst performers of all. I use NoScript but that is not perfect; you have to continuously adjust it for different sites, and you don't know WHICH sites need to be throttled down. It's wildly inefficient when we're shooting in the dark, because we DON'T KNOW WHICH BROWSER WINDOW is the jerkoff.
</p><p>BTW I have many WINDOWS open - almost never tabs. It is almost always massively more efficient than using tabs when you have many. Namely, with windows I can use Windows' own alt-tab, or click or hover the taskbar to navigate.
</p><p>I volunteer a lot of my time, a lot, both in technical areas and in personal charity. I'd do this myself, but I have no browser or HTML development background. Can't someone please come up with something? Asking for the millionth time, please? Sorry I'm getting nasty but there's all this senseless massive waste of time, and it will never go away - unless you heroically answer the call.

</p><p>Sync seemed a fairly good idea so I signed up to it recently, but what I was disturbed to realise was that I had accidentally allowed Mozilla to store more than 200 of my passwords on their cloud servers without realising it.  
</p><p>I have a password management solution that I have been using for some fifteen years and I know what I am doing.  I had allowed Firefox to store my passwords locally on my PC in the knowledge that the PC would have to be compromised and the encrypted passwords would have to be cracked to be of any use.
</p><p>So here's the problem; I am totally adversed to storing all of my logons and passwords in one place on the Internet with no control whatsoever as to how or where they are stored.
</p><p>I'm alarmed to see so little information about the storage of this highly sensitive Personal Data, specifically with regards to steps taken to secure it when it is such a honeypot for hackers.  I understand that every precaution will be taken to protect this data but things go wrong so often with regards to data breaches that it's just not something that anyone should consider lightly.  Handing over this level of responsibility to a third part (Mozilla) to protect every aspect of ones modern life is not advisable.
</p><p>What seems to have happened here is that Mozilla is so excited to get their trusted new features out to the user that they have forgotten to gain the trust of their users first by obtaining Explicit and Informed Consent to provide this functionality.
</p><p>So back to my question, how do I DELETE ALL of my Synced Logins &amp; Passwords and how do I know that you have deleted them?

Constantemente, o Windows 10 instala sozinho alguns aplicativos e consequentemente, substitui o Mozilla Firefox como navegador padrão, o Adobe, instala loja, etc. Já fiz bloqueio pelo BlockEdge mas não resolveu.. 
O Outro problema grave é que com a instalação sozinha feita pelo Windows 10, tudo que estava configurado no Firefox (Página Inicial, favoritos, Barra de Menu, Segurança de senha, etc) desaparece. Tenho que configurar o navegador Firefox tudo novamente. 
Por favor, alguém pode me ajudar como resolver e inibir que o Windows faça essas alterações no meu PC?
Geralmente, essas atualizações acontecem quando eu ligo o PC. 
Inclusive, quando eu coloco algum bloqueador, o PC fica sem ligar as vezes, até que seja instalado todas as atualizações que o Windows 10 quer... Eu já pensei que fosse problema com fonte, memória, ou coisa do tipo.. mas não é.
Um absurdo isso que o Windows está fazendo.. Esse navegador edge é muito ruim,,,,

Doing the same with Chrome doesn’t cause audio interruptions even opening a lot of tabs.
I think this is because hardware acceleration in Firefox isn’t working.
I think this because I see that the processor it is very loaded when opening multiple tabs of Firefox.

Am I right?
Why this problem doesn’t happen on Chrome?

Here is the error message displayed, “The current operation on 'Inbox' did not succeed. The mail server for account XXX responded: Command Error.12."" This also occurs when trying to delete (or even move) messages from any folder except the Trash folder (i.e. it lets me remove messages from the Trash folder). I am using Thunderbird for several email accounts, and this only occurs for this one email account, which is an imap account.
</p><p>I first fixed the problem by going into the Config editor and changing the value for this field (mail.server.default.send_client_info) from true to false (see <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1064915"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1064915</a> ). This worked for a couple of hours, then the problem re-occurred. I went ahead and changed the value back to true.
</p><p>Next, I tried deleting the Trash and Trash.msf files from my Profile folder, just in case they were corrupted (see <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/cannot-delete-messages"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/cannot-delete-messages</a> ). That initially did not work.  Then I tried also deleting the INBOX and INBOX.msf files, along with the Trash and Trash.msf files. It did not work until I restarted my computer. This fix worked for several days, but then reappeared.
</p><p>This first only occurred on my work computer (Windows 7 Professional) while using Thunderbird, then several days later it happened on my personal laptop (Mac OS 10.11.6) while using Thunderbird, and now (weeks later) it is happening on both. This does not happen when I access this email account with my phone (Android 7.1.1) nor online, neither of which use Thunderbird.
</p><p>Now neither fix works. I have even tried deleting all files and folders that do not contain actual email messages from my Profile folder (i.e. I deleted all files with extension .msf and all folders with extension.sbd). This did not work either.
</p><p>In addition, I used my phone (where I can still do things), and I emptied all of these folders: Trash, Deleted Items, Sent, Sent Items, Junk, Inbox. Next, I compacted everything. Then I deleted everything but actual email messages from my Profile folder. Lastly, I restarted my computer. This did not work.

In addition to this there is a subdirectory named /docs for some static documents which are independent from Oracle APEX.
</p><p>Within the Apache virtual host configuration the /docs directory is password-protected using the directives ""AuthType Basic"" and ""AuthName MyDir"" inside a &lt;Directory ...&gt; section - this is working fine so far.
</p><p>However, when being authenticated for the /docs directory, the credentials are also sent when requesting /apex/ or /i/ URLS - thus disturbing the Oracle APEX Authentication (which uses cookies). Doing some monitoring with Wireshark (after switching off SSL temporarily) shows that the credentials for the ""MyDir"" realm are sent in the HTTP header not only for /docs but just for every directory. After clearing the ""Active Logins"" the APEX login works fine again.
</p><p>Tested with FF 60 ESR (as well as with old FF 45.9 ESR).
</p><p>Is there any means to prevent this behaviour, i.e. that users do not have to clear ""Active Logins""?

I got a message that due to changes in Firefox the Firefox profile cannot be used anymore. Then I copied the profile folder manually and checked profiles.ini, but no way. I found an Firefox help article how to copy several files manually to the new profile (""Recovering important data from an old profile""). This seems to be a workaround, but I'm not sure if it restores the Firefox profile completely, and it is unexpected additional work to complete the Windows Restore. 
So my questions: 
Is there an easier way to get the restored Firefox profile running? Firefox synchronization is not allowed due to company policies. 
What is the technical reason for not accepting copied profiles anymore? BTW, there is still an article in the Firefox help recommending this: Back up and restore information in Firefox profiles

I switched to Safari for a while but I still like Firefox, so I came back, rationalizing that surely after many updates and months it must have been fixed. There is literally nothing the same on my current system - the OS is the latest. I use different software packages than I used to. The current Firefox installation is updated and running. And yet, it still just - vanishes. Randomly. No errors apparent. Nothing in the logs.

</p><p>Before I abandon Firefox entirely I thought I would ask - is there something I am missing here? What the heck is going on that it keeps doing this to me? I don't have stray seizures that strike the command key and Q - my hardware works fine and the batteries in the keyboard are fresh, my aura doesn't disrupt other electronics, I don't have other people using my system, I've refreshed Firefox and scanned for viruses and malware and gremlins and pixies - what else can I possibly do to fix this randomly disappearing browser window issue? The entire program just quits and all the windows go away. POOF. If I restart it pops right back to the windows I was using and restarts, only without whatever I was typing at the time it vanished.

Could someone please advise/reassure me on moving my Thunderbird 68.2.1 installation from Mac 10.11 to Windows 10?
I have watched this video <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/moving-thunderbird-data-to-a-new-computer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/moving-thunderbird-data-to-a-new-computer</a> and identified my profile folder on the Mac, which is at username &gt; Library &gt; Thunderbird &gt; Profiles &gt; xxxxxxx.default - I assume that's the one.
Firstly the video, which is more about moving between PCs, talks about cloud storage and external drives, but presumably I can just copy the 35 gig folder across my network to somewhere a new installation of Thunderbird will find and use it? This would probably make more sense for me given its size and the two systems.
The video suggests I would copy the profile folder within the ""Roaming"" folder on the PC which would presumably be created when I install TB, I think replacing a default installation Profile folder - is that all I need to do? Or have I misunderstood?
I installed a couple of extensions on TB on the Mac - Enigmail and Send Later (although under Troubleshooting it lists various others I didn't know about like dictionaries etc); what happens about these?
Thank you so much for any pointers!

It is supposed to be compatible with Android apps and google play store.  When I set it up I was able to log into google play and a few of my android apps were uploaded as compatible, Firefox was included.  I started with my ESET app which worked with no problems.  Every time I went to use Firefox the whole computer would freeze, but the curse was still moveable, but function-less.  The freeze would start any where from a few seconds into opening to a maybe 10 seconds into opening.  I 1st thought it was the chromebook so I exchanged it with another Asus C434TA. ( I am not sure if it is connected, but then the new one would not allow or load google play.  I was able to get that figured out and I think it was either something google did or it was also logging into google from a chrome browser google website and then it worked.)  I got ESET again worked good and then went to Firefox and it froze the chromebook just like before.  The only way out is to hold the power button down till it turns off and then turn it back on.  Firefox still will not work.  I cannot even get into the Firefox browser to try and submit a crash report of any kind without the whole chromebook freezing.  Please help, I only have a few days left to figure out if I need to return this chromebook or not.  I really hope I do not have to because I have heard it is a great chromebook and especially for the price.  Thank you, Jim!

Two times Windows and two times Xubuntu. TB works fine on 3 instances. The problem on the one Windows Thunderbird instance is that it takes more tan 30 seconds until the small window appears where I can type in my smtp server password. I never store passwords on my PC so that I have to type it every time I want to log in.
The problem occurs when I upgraded TB to the version 68.x.x. Meanwhile I changed to the 64 bit version, but this effort did not succeed. Now TB is installed in version 68.2.1, buildt 20191030212137, 64 bit. Everything else works as expected. In safe mode TB is connecting immediately. With all addons shut off it takes the 30 seconds ... That is why I assume that none of the add on is disturbing.
What parameter/value do I have to check?
Thanks

</p><p>- update manually Thunderbird to the last version 68 downloading it from the official Mozilla website
</p><p>- installed the new Ubuntu 19.10 in another partition and tried there with my account details

Each add on when it is updated forces it's own new tab into foreground, disturbing my current work, possibly causing time sensitive entries to be lost.  The problem is worse on the smaller system due to delays as add ons update and new tab opens. These get in my way and interfere with my business. Chrome is just as bad with this. Make these add ons better behaved. Show an indicator on the three bar menu icon, which already shows permission changes. I will get to it when free.  I want to choose when to view update info, and would be happy with a short update message with links to more info. Also would like to designate time of day or weekday that<strong>bold text</strong> Add Ons are allowed to update. Or have just one tab opened in the background where all such update messages appear. Also, as add-ons come in via Sync, do not default to adding to tool bar. That shrinks my URL text box at inopportune times.

However, I find that, in order to mirror this installation and any changes I make, I'll need to do everything all-over again on each computer. Worse, any changes I make on one computer when it comes to my profile and preferences, will not be shared by the others unless I copy/paste the proper profile file to the proper place.
</p><p>These days we live in the cloud, so, like other email programs, I'm wondering if anyone out there has a way to streamline the profile issue and point Thunderbird to one spot in the cloud where there is one profile and all computers and operating systems share it. I have multiple cloud accounts I could use (google, dropbox, onedrive).

I've had majority of the tabs open for several months so I would be able to scavenge most of what I lost from any older backups.

I have not closed FF after relaunching the first time after the crash in order not to create any more blank backups.

Firefox, access to <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a>.
You can see the symptoms such as video, input characters from a box google.

</p><p>Firefox 70 on a Fedora 30/31 KDE machine will freeze the entire machine within minutes (sometimes seconds) of launch.  A hard reboot is usually the only way to reset.  The issue is not associated with any particular URL.
</p><p>The System: 
</p><p>Operating System: Fedora 31 /
KDE Plasma Version: 5.16.5 /
KDE Frameworks Version: 5.61.0 /
Qt Version: 5.12.5 /
Kernel Version: 5.3.7-301.fc31.x86_64 /
OS Type: 64-bit /
Processors: 4 × Intel® Core™ i5-4590 CPU @ 3.30GHz /
Memory: 7.7 GiB of RAM
</p><p>When It Started: 
</p><p>The problem began as soon as Firefox was updated to version 70 on the Fedora 30 installation.  I then upgraded Fedora itself to 31, but the Firefox problem persisted.
</p><p>What I have tried:
</p><p>1. I created a brand new user on the system and ran Firefox from that account.  Problem still exists.
</p><p>2. I launched Firefox from the command line in safe mode. Problem still exists.
</p><pre>   $ firefox -safe-mode
</pre>
<p>3. I launched Firefox with Wayland.  Problem still exists.
</p><pre>   $ /usr/bin/firefox-wayland
</pre>
<p>4. I launched Firefox with X11.  Problem still exists.
</p><pre>   $ /usr/bin/firefox-x11
</pre>
<p><br>
Something odd:
</p><p>The user agent string being presented by Firefox is inaccurate.  It is presenting itself as 
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0
</p><p>And yet this is definitely FF70 on Fedora, as I can attest to, unless I have gone insane and am not realizing it yet.   It particularly troubles me that I have to post this support request from a different browser (so disregard the auto-detected user agent associated with this post).  Oh, the humanity!

</p><p>I have a new installation of TB 68.1.2 on a pc running Windows 10 (let's call it PC1) and I am trying to set up an IMAP account on a local mail server.
</p><p>Some background information:  The server accepts TLS connections on standard port 993, using a certificated signed by my own CA, and works flawlessly with other clients. The CA certificate is correctly installed in Thunderbird on PC1, and the IMAP account is created without problems. No antivirus potentially intercepting SSL connections is running. Moreover, another machine (say PC2) with a similar configuration (OS: Win10, TB version: 68.1.0) works correctly.
</p><p>The problem is that whenever TB connects to the server from PC1, a ""Add security exception"" dialog appears, complaining that the certificate is not valid (wrong site). To me the culprit is the string in the text field, which is ""<a href=""http://mail.mydomain.net:993"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.mydomain.net:993</a>"": in fact, if I remove "":993"" from that string TB is able to get the right certificate, but there seems to be no way to make the corrected string permanent, and the only option is to cancel the dialog window, bringing me back to the starting point.
</p><p>Is this some sort of bug, or am I doing something wrong?
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help.

I hope someone can help!  I've tried everything.
</p><p>I’m using a desktop; Dell; newer. Windows 10; 1903; plenty of speed and space left.
No viruses, etc.; have done many scans (malwarebytes, adware, etc.) 
</p><p>For whatever reason (I think I incorrectly shut down Firefox and/or my computer, and that was the beginning of the problem), Firefox is causing lot of issues.
</p><p>Won’t open or close. followed all the advice on this site.
</p><p>Found out on this site to try ending Firefox in task manager; when that didn’t work; went in to and deleted parent.lock from the profile.
</p><p>Then rebooted the computer; still wouldn’t open (or did once, but then had the same problem?)
Tried shutting off the computer and restarting rather than rebooting many times during all this process as well.
</p><p>I followed what someone said about adding the word OLD after places.sqlite.
So in the original profile folder I have:
</p><pre>    places.sqliteOLD
    places.sqlite-shmOLD
    places.sqlite-walOLD
</pre>
<p>that didn’t help things.
Then someone said to add OLD to ‘prefs.js’
</p><p>So I have:
</p><pre>      prefs.jsOLD
      prefs-1jsOLD
      prefs-2.jsOLD
      prefs-3.jsOLD
                  Etc….up to # 9; I have 9 of them
</pre>
<p>That didn’t help.
</p><p>I then saved that original profile to the desktop.
Uninstalled Firefox; and reinstalled it.
</p><p>If you go into profile folder, it shows the original profile(‘default’) and a new one I guess it creates when you reinstall Firefox? (called ’default-release’).
</p><p>I tried opening etc. with that new ‘default-release’ profile. 
Same issues.
Again I went into task manager, to end process (sometimes works for some of the instances; but usually not all?); deleted parent.lock again.
Rebooted.
</p><p>Then I created a brand new profile (without going into Firefox; but following some instructions on how to create a new profile without Firefox being open).
</p><p>I opened Firefox with that brand new profile (it asks me which of the 3 profiles I want to use when I went to open Firefox).
I opened tabs, used it, etc. works ok; …..
</p><p>BUT it won’t close or reopen! So same issues with the brand new profile!

I can get to the accounts with no problems using IE. I posted on someone else's same issue yesterday, but I deleted and reinstalled Firefox and didn't save that page so I don't know if anyone ever replied to it. 
I have removed all cookies, including corrupt cookies. I've removed all security software. I don't have any extensions activated. No ad blockers activated. 
On another site it was suggested it's a coding issue with the sites. How do I check/fix that?
The two sites I can't get onto are  citibankonline and billnet

Particular email threads won't download to Thunderbird from GoDaddy webmail,"<p>The email thread that is resisting downloading has a subject line with quotes and f/k/a in it. It looks like: Firstname Lastname / ""title"" f/k/a ""code"" Would quotes or slashes hold up these emails from downloading? GoDaddy checked and resynced email but nothing seems amiss on their end. The only way to get them down from webmail is to forward them to myself. Any help is appreciated. Thank you!
