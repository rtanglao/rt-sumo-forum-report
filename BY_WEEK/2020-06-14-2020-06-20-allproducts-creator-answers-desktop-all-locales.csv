1292004,2020-06-20 15:52:57 -0800,2020-06-21T00:52:16Z,"after changing from POP3 to IMAP, I cannot access either account settings","<p>I have used att email account, identified as primary by them, as POP3. I followed the directions to migrate to IMAP, omitting disabling the automatic check for messages on the POP3 account settings before setting up the IMAP. The email address is identical on both accounts, and Thunderbird apparently only uses that to identify the account. So now there are two accounts, one POP3, one IMAP, with the same email address. I cannot access settings on either: I get the message ""An account with this name already exists. Please enter a different account name."" All of my existing email has shown up on the IMAP download, and the POP3 doesn't appear to be checking for mail, since no new has shown there but new has shown on the IMAP. (I left the email on the server under POP3 to be able to access it from multiple devices, and I made this change when I got the message that att was no longer supporting the protocols to do this.) Three questions: 1) How do I get Thunderbird to let me access settings for either account? 2) Should I send my POP3 downloaded email to my current ISP provided email account to ensure that I don't lose anything when I delete the POP3 account? 3) I fear that if I tell Thunderbird to delete my POP3 account, I might just lose both. How do I avoid this? </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1326031;1326103;,AlC-Stua,false,false,2

I never really cared about it, but now I want to know. Why is the browser using so much memory? I can't understand how a single tab of, let's say, Youtube on low-quality, generally 360p, is using more than 2 GB of my Systems RAM. I looked up a setting that changes the browser to 1 process, and it helps if I do not have a lot of tabs open. But enabling the setting does nothing. I still have around 6 to 8 processes in my task manager and their total memory usage simply doesn't justify it. If I play a more or less a few-years-old game, I get less memory usage from it than from one tab with a video on it. Heck, actual movies in my video player take much less memory.  Can someone explain to me how this is happening and how I can circumvent the 6-8 processes, which pop-up despite me changing it to 1 process in the settings? Excuse my German screenshot, but it should be understandable that I set it to 1 content process. Also it shows how my browser uses 1 entire Gigabyte of RAM just for this website.

Someone from Firefox responded, but he didn't provide an answer for me.....at least not immediately.  In the meantime I contacted the support team for one of the apps (Bitwarden, to be specific), and they were able to provide the solution.  I informed the Firefox person who contacted me that a solution had been found, and he asked me to post that solution here, since I was not the only one posting such a question yesterday.  If your app icons disappear from your browser toolbar, then the solution is to create a new profile for your Firefox account, because the old one has apparently been corrupted.  As soon as I created that new profile, all my previous app icons immediately appeared on the browser toolbar, with no further actions required by me.  I hope this information will help some of you.  It is possible, I guess, that other browser problems incurred might also be resolved by creating a new profile. </p>",firefox-770;customize;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,customize,en-US,1325483;1325514;,jhc8844,true,James,2

Some users have even given their own hard-earned money to Mozilla, so they expect at least of modicum of human decency when it comes to Mozilla not deceiving them through lies or blatant omission of facts.

I need to disable the shortcut keys but cannot find where or how to turn them off. This seems very odd as I am sure its a popular need, at least for certain keys let alone the complete set.

However, firefox's shortcut keys are interferring with those of the much more useful Phrase Express.  I am astonished that a simple answer was not easily available whilst searching other questions etc. However, many similar questions were many years out of date and lead me to various addons which were no longer active. This cannot be a difficult thing to do, after all many people (will never even use them and even programs developed my single progammers usually have a simple series of options available in settings to turn them on or off or indeed customise them. </p><p>So, can someone please help, the need to use phrase express is essential to cope with my neck and arm problems but I wish to leave Chrome and more importantly Google behind me. </p><p>Thank you in advance for your guidance and assistance. </p>",firefox-770;customize;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,customize,en-US,1325109;1325482;1325489;1325495;1325759;1325786;1325788;1325801;1325920;,latham.marcus,true,latham.marcus,9
1291635,2020-06-17 17:40:07 -0800,2020-07-02T16:48:02Z,"Fonts, Resources and Scrolling","<p>Hi everyone. </p><p>I've got a couple of (not so) small pet peeves. </p><p>I'm somewhat used to Chromium based browsers - in particular, I've been quite close with the Brave for a bit now. It's beginning to crumble in my eyes, ever since the somewhat unpleasant incident happened, with people discovering that the Brave team has been injecting their own affiliate links into the sites of different cryptocurrency exchanges, without any prior notice. Anyhow, I digress. </p><p>I like Firefox. I like the fact that I can keep all of my passwords safe behind one master password. I like the customization features that Firefox can showcase. I'm not particularly thrilled with 10 different versions of what's supposed to be, as it seems, just one product - from Firefox to Firefox Developer Edition, to Firefox Nightly, Firefox Focus, Firefox Entreprise, but I can understand why they seem to coexist together as one whole. I like the mission that the team of Firefox aligns itself with and I'd love to be able to contribute to it. And for me, contribution to anything starts with becoming a fan myself. </p><p>Unfortunately, I've got a couple of things that keep tripping me up. I'm using Windows 10. I've got Firefox installed. I've configured it to my liking. And yet I keep going back to Brave, after every single attempt to remain on Firefox only. </p><p>There are 3 reasons why. </p><p>1) WTF is wrong with the fonts? </p><p>I've configured Brave and Firefox to have the exact same font preferences. </p><p>Same fonts. Same size. Same settings.  </p><p>Same website, for the sake of an example: </p><p><a href=""https://www.zipcon.net/~swhite/docs/computers/browsers/fonttest.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.zipcon.net/~swhite/docs/computers/browsers/fonttest.html</a> </p><p>Brave paints fonts normally. I don't know why, but it does. </p><p><a href=""https://i.imgur.com/RSJuzcU.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://i.imgur.com/RSJuzcU.png</a> </p><p>Firefox displays the exact same text. But bolder. Jaggier. And uglier. </p><p><a href=""https://i.imgur.com/xRIr1n1.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://i.imgur.com/xRIr1n1.png</a> </p><p>Showing them separetely won't help much, so here's a side-by-side comparison. </p><p><a href=""https://i.imgur.com/zxQjWE1.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://i.imgur.com/zxQjWE1.png</a> </p><p>If it looks the same to you, try to open the images in a new tab and looking at them at full, 100% resolution. </p><p>What is true for this site is true for any other application. What looks quite pretty and smooth in Brave looks bolder, heavier, ""in your face"", rugged, ugly, jaggy in Firefox - and I have no clue what to do about it. I've tried playing with about:config for days and days - nothing changes, no matter which font_rendering mode I pick. I've tried to play with extensions - they have no effect. I've tried to disable hardware acceleration. It does nothing. Fonts in Firefox keep looking like something, made for displays of 2000. Not 2020. If there's anything you can recommend me here - I'd be very grateful. </p><p>P.S. Tried and tested on both Firefox and Firefox Developer Edition. Nothing changes. </p><p>2) WTH is wrong with RAM consumption? </p><p>I remember reading somewhere a whole lot of articles, claiming that Chrome (and Chromium based browsers, therefore?) loves to keep as much RAM to itself as possible. While Firefox, on the other hand, is much lighter on resources. As much as I'd like to believe it to be true, my observations tell me the exact opposite. </p><p>Here's a screenshot from the Task Manager of Brave and Firefox with the same tabs and websites opened. </p><p><a href=""https://i.imgur.com/omhswRZ.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://i.imgur.com/omhswRZ.png</a> </p><p>Compared to Brave, Firefox consistently holds 2 to 5 times as much RAM. Furthermore, it's much more active in terms of CPU load as well, making the task manager claim that the electricity consumption is much higher for Firefox than it is for Brave. </p><p>I'd love to know why. </p><p>But I'd love even more for Firefox to simply be (a lot) less greedy when it comes to resources. </p><p>The fact that the extension library for Firefox is already much more reduced, compared to what's available for Chromium based platforms, I see very little sense in using Firefox if, in addition to making the websites I've gotten used to - uglier, it requires more RAM and CPU power in order to do so. There's just no point. </p><p>3) What's the deal with the freezing every X scrolls? </p><p>I don't like making these comparisons. I don't want to make these comparisons. I'd love to be able to say with confidence ""Firefox rules! Everything else can be dumped.""  </p><p>Instead, however, I'm typing this text, to say that every 5 or 10 ""smooth"" scrolls on Firefox inevitably produce a not-so-critical, but oh-so-much-annoying lag, where the page that's supposed to scroll smoothly momentarily freezes and then jumps in one go to the next place, totally ruining what's supposed to be a completely ""smooth"" scrolling ""experience"".  </p><p>I've tried disabling hardware acceleration here as well. Does nothing. Tried to play with setting. Doesn't help. </p><p>I tried to disable the smooth scrolling feature altogether. In addition to make the browsing experience more unpleasant, it becomes even more painful, as the scrolls that are supposed to be regular and continuous, moving the page up or down in regular intervals of time, happen to suddenly freeze once again and they try to ""recover"" the lost ground by ""pushing"" the page forcefully in the direction of the scroll. This is just painful. Brave doesn't have these issues. Chrome doesn't have these issues. Vivaldi is perfectly smooth. What's the deal with scrolling on Firefox? </p><p>- </p><p>If anyone can guide me here to solve all of the issues I've just described - once and for all, I'll be genuinely grateful. I've tried to find solutions to these problems over and over. And either I didn't find any answer that could help solve these problems even slightly, or I found somewhat amusing, to me, answers directly in the Firefox's wiki - asking, for instance, to simply ""Restart Firefox"" when it becomes too much of a hog for RAM: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-uses-too-much-memory-or-cpu-resources?redirectlocale=en-US&amp;redirectslug=firefox-uses-too-much-memory-ram"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-uses-too-much-memory-or-cpu-resources?redirectlocale=en-US&amp;redirectslug=firefox-uses-too-much-memory-ram</a> </p><p>--- QUOTE --- </p><p>Firefox may use more system resources if it's left open for long periods of time. A workaround for this is to periodically restart Firefox. You can configure Firefox to save your tabs and windows so that when you start it again, you can start where you left off. See Restore previous session - Configure when Firefox shows your most recent tabs and windows for details. </p><p>--- END --- </p><p>I am sorry, but what kind of BS is that? It ""may use more system resources""? And it may not? Who's in the charge of this? What makes it impossible to look further into this, and make sure there's no need for any ""workaround""s? Is it impossible to program it once and for all to avoid using more resources, especially when it remains perfectly still? Because I've seen it myself going from 1'200 MB in RAM to 2'400 MB in RAM - WITHOUT ME DOING ANYTHING. AT ALL. Is it impossible to fix? With all the manpower that Mozilla possesses? Is it such a low priority? Or is it just my PC having fun at making Firefox resource greediness go out of hand? </p><p>... </p><p>Pardon me, I had to let this out. I genuinely want to use Firefox. I feel much more emotionally connected to your browser than to any other, guys.  </p><p>But I don't want to experience pain each and every time I use it.  </p><p>The ugly fonts are not pleasant to look at. And they distract me from my work.  </p><p>The RAM consumption makes the whole experience heavier. And it bothers the heck out of me. I don't want to restart Firefox just for ""workarounds"". If I have to restart it, I want it to be for a valid reason. Not because it ""just so happens"" that the browser ""may use more system resources"" (with a dropped ""than necessary"" at the end) - and no one even bothers to fix it.  </p><p>Finally, I don't want to get distracted by lagged scrolling. If I'm browsing the page, I want to be focused on the content. Not on what my browser is doing. And as of now, every time I use Firefox, I'm forced to think of why is the screen not moving up or down the way I expect it to, instead of thinking about what is on this screen. </p><p>If there's anything you can advise me, please do. </p><p>If you feel the need to troubleshoot this further, I'm willing to provide as much data as I can. </p><p>If these issues pertain only to my system, then the bug is on my machine - and I'd be happy to fix as soon as possible before switching full-time to Firefox once and for all. </p><p>Going through the support tickets though, it appears I might not be the only one. And if this is the case, perhaps a more deep investigation into the current Firefox experience, at least pertaining to modern machines, running Windows - might be necessary. </p>",firefox-780;beta;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1325242;1325253;1329406;,bruce.william.collins,false,false,2

I originally posted this description of my problem to the question “Cannot send email” which was active in April of this year, but in my case the problem seems to have become permanent and also includes the failure to deliver incoming email, so I thought it warranted the creation of a new question thread. Essentially the problem seems like the one noted above. After running for (literally) years my Thunderbird setup has suddenly over the last three days has (a) failed to deliver incoming e-mail after it arrives or when it is requested via “Get Messages”, &amp; (b) failed to send output messages, claiming that the output server ""was lost in the middle of the transaction"".  My internet provider is Primus Canada. In discussion with their technical support it appears that the handling of both incoming and outgoing emails by the servers is working as expected. In addition, webmail applications as run on Firefox, my i-pad, and my i-phone all seem fine (although inconvenient as a long-term working backup). The problem therefore seems to reside with Thunderbird, whose settings had not been changed at all for some time now. I am running Windows 10 Home 64 bit (v1909, build 18393.900), Thunderbird (68.9.0 - 32 bit), Firefox (77.0.1 - 64 bit) all of which are up-to-date versions. Has anyone any suggestions as to what may be happening, or further lines of investigation? [P.S. I should now add that Thunderbird does seem to perform a ""batch"" load of queued incoming e-mails, following a system shutdown/restart and reload of the program. In addition, the sending problem seems to have disappeared (at least temporarily and for messages sent to myself) after I simplified the Outgoing Mail Server definitions for <a href=""http://smtp.primus.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.primus.ca</a> to a single default server used by all six of my e-mail accounts.

It doesn't allow you to drag off the page, and the full page option simply gives me a picture of what i can see, including the scrollbar to show that there's more content off screen. </p><p>I thought this might be something to do with running multiple monitors, but it's just the same when running on laptop only. </p><p>Can anyone advise: - what was the last version of Firefox to include the snipping tool, and - where can I download this? </p><p>For someone who spends a lot of time writing training materials, it was an awesome piece of functionality, and rolling back seems to be my only option. </p><p>Thanks in advance, </p><p>Ian </p>",download-and-install_1;desktop;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1324890;1324915;,ian.wallbridge,false,false,2

However, Thunderbird wasn't able to do the same for a third account. When I entered the same basic information as for the other two accounts. Thunderbird set up a skeleton account, without file structure, emails or contact lists. I made sure that the entry information was correct, even to the extent of going to the email provider, changing my password, and entering it into Thunderbird. But still, nothing other than a blank email account. So, two questions: </p><p>First, in the password manager I unfortunately deleted the relevant entry for this third account, thinking that there would be a simple way of entering a new password. Then I found that the password manager <em><strong>doesn't</strong></em> have a way of simply entering new passwords, you have to edit the old ones. Do I have to delete the entire account now and re-enter it? Or is there some weird, secret way of entering new passwords? I juggled with the account trying to get it to ask me for a new password, but no luck. </p><p>Second, does anyone have any idea what other things might be done to get Thunderbird to cough up the old file structure, old emails and old contacts that it so generously provided to me on the other two email accounts? </p><p>It would have made more sense to me if, because of some unknown (to me) problem Thunderbird had simply refused to produce the third email account instead of coming up with a bare bones version. Obviously Thunderbird still has the information that it contained before it became inoperable after the most recent update. After all, it did belch forth the desired contents for the first two email accounts. Why would it compromise on the third by just producing an empty account? </p><p>All responsive help and wisdom will be much appreciated. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,1325565;,rfjaffe,false,false,1

I'm not entirely satisfied with it, so I went looking for something else. Multi-Account Container Tabs sounded more like what I needed.  But it isn't turning out that way. </p><p>I've created my containers -- after deciding on the order I want, as you cannot (apparently) rearrange them once created. But none of the instructions are quite clear on how to now assign all my favorite tabs to the correct containers. The instructions posted by Mozilla talk about sending links from pages but not so much about assigning specific tabs to containers. </p><p>I have managed to do this by accident once or twice; no idea how. But for the most part, even though I select the option to ""reopen in [name] container,"" and even though it appears to do so (in that it duplicates the tab and puts a color-coded line at the bottom of the tab), as soon as I close the tab, it is no longer listed under that container. Also, it seems only sporadically to retain the pinned tabs as pinned. </p><p>This whole process seems to be pointless if the extension can't retain the tabs in the containers where I reopen them (which is the only method I've seen so far to get them into a specific container) so that they can be pulled up again when that group is needed. I must be missing something. Could other extensions be interfering? (My context menu doesn't look quite like the images in the instructions, but at least the ""reopen in [name} container"" is an available option, even if I have to go an extra step to get to the actual list of containers. </p><p>I don't mind going the extra step and can clear up my context menu later; but why bother using this extension if the containers can't retain the web site tabs I assign them to (again, assuming that ""reopening"" to a specific container is the way to do this ... and maybe it isn't, but I can't find another way)? NOTE: I don't want to simply assign random links to containers; I want my specific TABS to open when I choose a container. </p><p>Again, I've read the instructions provided by Mozilla. Either 1) they aren't clear enough, 2) this extension doesn't do what I thought it did, or 3) I am missing something big-time. </p><p>Any help would be appreciated.

So in the suggested way there's no hopping with the cursor (its movement reduces at least by 50%) and it is fast and intuitive in situations where you only glance the B tab, or both A and B: BAB; BABA; etc, but it can always be used.

The beauty of tags is that you can tag one email with multiple tags - for instance, an email might be both Important (red) and Personal (green). But when an email is tagged, the email text in the inbox panel turns only one of these colours, which is misleading and frustrating - and the names of the tags are also both this colour, when they should be their own colours. I liked the function in outlook mail whereby an email would stay in black text, and coloured bars would show the tags. Is there a way to adapt to a similar function in Thunderbird - or at least to stop the email turning coloured on tagging? I've looked, and I can't find this in forums.

The win7_64 PC is used with developer apps and UAC is turned off, although there is other 3rd party browser protection running. </p><p>Both PCs have been running FF version 56 with all the tools and addons I know and love.  I also have a link to standalone chrome (dirty word) on each desktop. With more sites going HTTPS with higher security FFv56 was struggling with certificates. I upgraded the 32 bit PC to latest FFv77. The menue bar shows the Favicon in the top right corner for each site visited but when the URL is highlighted and dragged from the locked padlock it appears on the default Win7 blue background as the Firefox icon on a white background. Although I'd prefer the Favicon, I can live with that. </p><p>The Win7_64 no UAC PC running v56 has the same FF icon on a white background. I decided to uninstall V56 from Windows programs and install the latest V77. </p><p>The install finished with all the bookmark links as before (good) but the entire desk top of two monitors full of url links was changed to the FF icons with a BLACK background. On a pale blue screen this is a nightmare garish issue. I over came the first problem of not being able to drag urls by using the launcher switch -no-deelevate. The existing icon links stayed as FF icon on a black background.  </p><p>Then I went to Monitor display settings changing from 32bit to 16 bit colour rebooted and all the desktop links changed. (strange). After reading FF support guidance I changed UAC from zero to default, rebooted and just about everything on the desktop changed with Windows error messages popping up for applications.  I reverted back to AAC and the previous position. </p><p>O.K so now my option was to try an absolutely clean re-install of FFv77. To do this isn't so easy. I searched and found the Mozilla folders and profiles, but there was still an awful lot left in the registry including some keys from previous FF updates and versions. After cleaning that out manually the Win7_64 was as clean of Mozilla as I could make it. Installed latest FFv77 which booted to the default profile but all the existing desktop url links came back with black backgrounds - Horrible! </p><p>Throughout all of this, I can install and open Chrome (still with no PC UAC) and browse o.k, with no surprise changes to desktop links, problems accessing SSL protected sites or having to add custom switches to a startup launcher.  I don't know if my problems are Windows OS related or Firefox new versions have problems with Win7, but there is none of this with Chrome straight out of the box and the issue of Firefox icons and Favicons keeps being raised by others. Some may be able to put up with the black background URL links but when you have a screenful across two monitors IMHO it is really horrible. </p><p>I have an image backup to FFV56 and I'm willing to try something else. What is the default for the FF desktop URLs after a new build, is it a Favicon, Firefox icon on a black background or the same on a white bckground - or something else? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",download-and-install_1;desktop;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1323848;1324092;1324094;,Jimbo100,false,false,3
