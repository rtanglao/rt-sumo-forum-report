The Status categories for email messages should include a Sent choice, but doesn't.  Please add that, and include a settings option to automatically assign that to all sent email messages.  The Status options under Message menu, Mark, doesn't include Sent, which is critical to tracking which email messages have been sent, when they are moved out of the Sent folder to another local folder, which I feel every email client should provide.  It is the companion to received messages Read status. </p><p>I've requested this in the past, which was requested by others several years ago (<a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=280606"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=280606</a> ), but would like to know what it would take (such as a contribution to fund the change) to add it.  This is one of the biggest deficiencies in Thunderbird, and how version 1 ever got released without it is beyond me. </p><p><br> 2. The content and layout of composed plain-text emails sometimes is altered when the message is sent.  Sometimes an extra space character is added at the beginning of lines of text (generally when a new message is created via Edit as New Message), sometimes a space character will be removed between words, and sometimes a blank line separating paragraphs will be removed. </p><p>I haven't figured out a consistent pattern as to what triggers this, though it may have to do with converting URL links text to clickable links when sent, which is a conversion no other email client that I've used performs (those generally auto detect and convert the URL to a clickable link, but it is shown that way in the unsent (draft) message. </p><p>The point is, it isn't what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSISWYG) in Thunderbird, when composing a message.  And even the underlining of a word or phrase, allows no control over the underlining (always an extra underline character before and after the word or phrase).  For decades, basic editing of text has provided a toolbar button for Underline of selected text, which is what Thunderbird should also offer.  Again, it's a WYSIWYG issue. </p><p><br> 3. When a message tab is open, and vertically scrolled down, and a different tab is selected, then that scrolled-down tab is reselected, it is displayed with with the vertical scroll button (and message content) at the top of the message.  It should remember where each tab's vertical scrolling was previously at, as Mozilla Firefox does with its tabs. </p><p><br> </p><p>edit: spaces at start of each paragraphs was causing horizontal scrollbars. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",sdsol,false,false,0

This issue happens when I click on a link in another app and it brings up the in-app browser.

But when I open up the web app, it it stuck with a white screen. </li><li> I have set the browser to close all open tabs upon quitting the browser, but after re-opening the tabs are still there. </li></ol> <p>So these are just some of the issues with the new Android browser.

Yahoo mail, does interestingly, as will all other non-Gmail accounts, work flawlessly with Firefox. Perhaps the flaw is solely with Firefox when it handshakes with gmail's security protocol, because error code #2005  is what always pops up. Another error message says that Hangouts has not been signed in. And while I do have 2 phone numbers for two Gmail accounts, Gmail also signs me out of 4 other accounts that have no phone numbers.  </p><p>Here's the list of troubleshooting steps attempted recently.

One of them is located on Desktop A, and the second is on Desktop B. </p><p>When I click a link in an external program -- for example, Outlook, or Excel -- it shell executes that link.  Firefox is set as my default browser, and so it handles the link.  The problem is that when I click a link while looking at Desktop A, the link gets opened by the Firefox window on Desktop B and switches my view there, which takes me away from what I'm working on and forces me to move that tab back to Desktop A manually. </p><p>Furthermore, this is not consistent behavior.  Sometimes clicking a link will cause Firefox to open a new tab in a window in the same desktop I was looking at when I clicked it.  Other times it switches to the other desktop.  I have not been able to figure out what determines which Firefox window gets the link. </p><p>All I really want is for links to open in the Firefox window that's already open in the same desktop as where I clicked the link.  Is there some way to make that happen?  I'm not sure if this a problem with Firefox or with how Windows handles shell-executing links.

I want to know how secure my password data will be e.g., salted hashes, anonymizing my data and identities. It would be great to have redundancy just in case my primary password manager's company goes bankrupt or some other disaster happens which knocks out my service provider. They are very clear on how secure my data is and what steps are being taken to ensure said claims. I can make assumptions on the types of encryption both at rest and in transit, but to assume makes an ass out of ""u"" and me. </p><p>Also, what happens when an overreaching L/E entity or nation state requests a Lockwise user's data? What is handed over. Yes, I have checked the privacy policies that Mozilla has put out, but this question ties back to my first question. Are the logins and passwords recoverable by outside sources? Does Mozilla have access to the encryption key or build a back door into Lockwise? Again, none of this is addressed in the documentation. I get it, it's written by volunteers, but we are requesting better and greater transparency. </p><p>Lastly, I would be curious to know where the single points of failure lay within the Lockwise system and what steps Mozilla and the Lockwise dev team are taking to address these issues.

Until recently, I needed only to copy the email files of PROFILES over to my Windows 10 computers for the Windows 10 version of Thunderbird to continue working.  The last several updates of Thunderbird have botched that straight forward procedure so that when I copy the PROFILES over to Windows 10 after an update on Windows 7, the Windows 10 version tells me that it flatly refuses to work.  Only by then copying the entirety of the Mozilla Thunderbird directory from Program Files (x86) is the Windows 10 version then willing to proceed to function at all.  Even then, it demands that I REINSTALL my essential ""Manually Sort Folders"" function each and every time that I have replaced the PROFILES files.  Is there any cure for this messiness other than (1) copying Mozilla Thunderbird directory from Program Files after each nonsense ""update"" along with the PROFILES #OR# (2) refusing to allow updates to my primary Windows 7 installation of Thunderbird.  I don't know what, if anything relevant, I might be missing by refusing to allow updates but the expansion of time and energy for maintaining a functional Thunderbird installation on Windows 10 (without allowing it to gather new emails that aren't in my Windows 7 version by allowing it access to the Internet).  But forcing updates across multiple systems is a problematic procedure unless it is done on a ""forgiving"" basis not currently extant. </p>",other;,thunderbird,other,en-US,"",bobgru,false,false,0

It wouldn't even open. Consequently, I had to clean the remainder out and reinstall FF and set it up again to my liking. Since then, Email Link is not working properly. In fact it runs wild and is difficult to stop. In the Options&gt;&gt;Application I have mailto set to Use Microsoft Outlook just as it was before the reinstall which worked correctly.  Now what happens is it gets itself into a never-ending reiteration or opening a new tab in FF, which then does something to open a new iteration of Outlook with the legend Navigation to the webpage was cancelled as shown in the attached screenshot. This somehow manages to open another new tab in FF and so on and so forth, until I manage to stop it. Below is the address I was testing with in a separate FF instance, and was a link to Google which is normally my default New Tab page (don't judge!) mailto:?body=https%3a%2f%<a href=""http://2fwww.google.co.nz"" rel=""nofollow"">2fwww.google.co.nz</a>%2f&amp;subject=google I don't recognise much of the items on the menu bar, and if I click on the drop down menu  where the above address appears, all it comes up with is Add or Remove buttons.

Before version 68 that was possible with themes, but those themes are not working anymore. </p><p>So, as a simple approach, consider, I want to have a light green color as the background color and black as a foreground color for the 3 main panes. Thus I changed the background color in Preferences/Display/Formatting/Colors/Background to #90ee90 (hereafter #XXXXXX). However, this only changes the background color of the mail-viewing pane. The other two are left as they were before. </p><p>Q1: How are the pane foreground and background colors for all panes supposed to be changed? </p><p>--- Then I read about the Webextensions on <a href=""https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/examples/web-extension-themes#additional-color-properties"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/examples/web-extension-themes#additional-color-properties</a> </p><p>I tried the simple and the full example, and set tab_background_text to #XXXXXX, and theme_frame to one of my HD images. tab_background_text was the only one with a background in its name. Surprisingly, this changed the foreground color of the menus to #XXXXXX. The panes were left as they were before. </p><p>Q2: Is there a full list of the attribute names and their meanings?  Q3: What are the names of the pane foreground and background colors?  Q4: As someone not familiar with json, can you tell me what #XXX (other than #000 and #FFF) means. It looks like nibble color codes, but its not really explained somewhere. </p><p>Btw If you have an xpi, and you change the theme_frame image, and by chance, the image name in the manifest is incorrect, then Thunderbird still reuses the old image, even after a restart, and even if the complete add-on was removed before.  Q5: Is this the way it is supposed to be? </p><p>Thanks Thomas </p>",customize;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1326822;1326949;1327015;1327232;1327286;1328375;1328398;1328400;1328412;1329270;1329469;1329482;1329496;1329785;1329788;,pahhur,false,false,15

The problem is that not only don't we use it, but almost no US online forms are designed to accept it.  Virtually every form on any website in the US is set up to expect a TEN DIGIT phone number without any area code.  This is especially true of forms for businesses that only do business with customers in the US. </p><p>I have rarely found any online form in the US that <em>needs</em> the country code -- exactly the contrary I have found numerous online forms that fail when Firefox attempts to enter a phone number with the +1 area code.  Some forms reject the + as a non-numeric character.  Other forms reject the entire phone number entry for having too many characters.  Probably most common are forms that take the numbers as being a standard 10-digit phone number which the form truncates at just 10 digits (cutting off the last one or two digits that Firefox sends).   </p><p>The <strong>fact</strong> that most online forms in the US cannot process a phone number with any country code seems strange considering how many of our web coders are international workers on H2-B visas - but it is absolutely true that most of our online forms <em>cannot</em> process a phone number of more than 10 digits. </p><p>I always enter the phone number as just the 10 digits, but Firefox insists on adding the +1, even when I edit the saved address to remove the +1 Firefox will soon add it again. </p>",firefox-770;other;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",n4aof,false,false,0

A day? A week AND did I respond to them? : no way to track this 3) multi-column sort by message threads isn't possible: most recent messages are buried at the BOTTOM of a large list of emails responded to and you still don't know who you need to respond by type eg. you need to get back to your boss fast, but not XYZ who is also sending details about the same message thread title </p><p>There must be a VERY simple way to solve this: to see WHO you need to get back to quickly. But there isn't and it's ONLY because of one small problem: you can't multi-sort the main Thunderbird window ( and as discussed in one <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1279557"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1279557</a> ) which suggests using Menu -&gt; View -&gt; Sort By which ONLY allows for sorting by ONE column at a time which does not help with the above. But there is an easy solution to this.  </p><p>Although ( as an advanced user ) you could created custom columns using the Thunderbird Extensions Developers panel as described in this help topic <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Thunderbird/Thunderbird_extensions/Creating_a_Custom_Column"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Thunderbird/Thunderbird_extensions/Creating_a_Custom_Column</a> and IF you populated the data needed for a drop down with say 0: ASAP; 1: respond in 1 hr; 2: respond in 1 day there is STILL no way to see who you need to get back to quickly because you can't multi-column sort your inbox in Thunderbird. More, if you get an email from BOB @GMAIL.com you can't always have him assigned to a ""Respond in 1 hr"" tag. Or a ""Respond in 1 day"" tag. BUT with a super simple plugin called ""ColumnsWizard"" <a href=""https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/tag/custom%20columns"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/tag/custom%20columns</a> you are 50% of the way there. Super right? Almost.  </p><p>The ability for Thunderbird to become an incredibly simple CRM like system for any email user is therefore screwed because there is no multi-column inbox sortting. However by using a great Thunderbird plugin called ""ColumnsWizard"" and simple multi-column inbox sort functionality, by say, a custom column called PRIORITY ( 0: respond ASAP; 1: respond in 1 hr; 2: respond in 1 day ) then any Thunderbird user has an instant and very simple way to make sure you don't loose things. An instant CRM.   </p><p>Has anyone ever solved such a simple problem with Thunderbird? Multi-Column inbox sorting ?  </p><p>To this I've even created a very specific functionality request topic for multi-column inbox sorting:  <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1647282"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1647282</a> for multi column sort because with that, so many great capabilities of Thunderbird come to light. </p>",customize;bug1647282;bug1037857;,thunderbird,customize-controls-options-and-add-ons,en-US,1326479;1327199;1327475;1327542;1328703;1328712;1328722;,silent_thunderbird,false,false,7

I suppose I could set up Lockwise with her so that I have access but since I'm probably not going to be checking her accounts regularly, it seems like a security risk for her.
