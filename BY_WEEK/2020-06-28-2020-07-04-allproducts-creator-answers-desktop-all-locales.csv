It seems to be triggered by the mouse scrolling wheel.

My standard browsing habit consists of launching browser with 1 pinned tab and 1 home page (so 2 tabs only), then opening 5-10 tabs from my bookmarks, checking pages then closing them and leaving only 1 pinned page open. In firefox 78.0.1 after doing this (opening and then closing multiple tabs ""to the right"" using new context menu added in 78) my ram usage does not drop. It goes from 2.4GB (system only usage) to 5.0GB and does not drop after closing tabs. However when I open 10-20 tabs again RAM usage does not rise (maybe slightly, like 5.3GB). So it looks like firefox has multiple tabs stored in ram and opening new tabs just rewrites that memory instead of allocating new one. I have 8GB of ram so 3GB of usage from 1 open tab is crazy. I think it was 500-900MB before. I also have terrible lags because of this - browser hangs up every few seconds for few seconds. I had trouble writing this post with 2 tabs open because of 3.3GB ram usage! Restarting browser helps - ram uasge rises from 2.4GB to 3.2GB only (800MB for 2 tabs) but every new opened and closed tab seems to stay in memory. For example if I open 10 more tabs except for 2 that always open so I have 12 tabs I have 3.6GB memory usage. After I close them it slowly drops to 3.5GB instead of returning to 3.2GB. It does not matter how I close tabs - using right click context menu (close other tabs, close tabs to the right), using X on tabs, or using add-on to close all tabs except for pinned ones. They always remain in memory somehow. PLS fix this ASAP. </p><p>P.S. I also tried checking about:performance menu but there is nothing interesting here. It says that 2 opened tabs and addons use 100MB of memory which is not true because browser at this moment uses 1060MB. </p><p>Update 1: I also tested safe mode. 3,4GB of PC RAM usage on firefox safe mode start. Opened few tabs, ram usage goes to 4.2GB. After closing all tabs except for 1 ram usage start to SLOWLY decrease but it stops at 3,7GB. Ram usage drop was really slow like 10-30 seconds. It should be instant after closing tabs. </p>",firefox-780;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Piterk,false,false,0

But disabling all extensions and plugins in a normal window doesn't solve it.

I was lead to believe FF would then create a new folder when this happened, but it just kicked up an error for me and wouldn't start. When I moved the old profile folder back and started up the freshly installed version with the old profile folder, the problems were all solved. Though as mentioned, they are starting to happen again on some of the sites. No errors or changes have been made that I can identify, plenty of space available on the HDD, etc.  </p><p>I've become a big fan of FF over the years (over Chrome), and want to stay in a privacy-focused browser, but I haven't been able to find much that seems to help this specific situation online.

As of this update, Firefox no longer opens these files, instead it forces me to download the link file, and then click on the downloaded link file to instatiate it. Of course, this means that I cannot open the link file in Private mode. This is cluttering up my download folder, forcing the web page referenced into non-private mode, and causing cascading problems from there. What is the setting that will allow me to click on my bookmarked .lnk files (which in most cases open .html web pages) and open directly. If I can't do this then I'll have to migrate away from Firefox, which I absolutely do not want to do. </p><p>Thank you.

However today (Thurs), it has suddenly stopped working.  On startup, and any time I try to Get Messages or open a web server folder, I get this message in the lower-right corner: </p><p>The current operation on'&lt;folder&gt;' did not succeed.  The mail server for account xxxxxxxxx@bell.net responded:  Invalid attribute list in UID FETCH. </p><p>This is not the same as the box I occasionally get asking for a password.  Here is more information: </p> <ul><li> Running Windows 10 </li></ul> <ul><li> When the problem started, I upgraded Thunderbird form V38.5.0 to V68.10.0   It wouldn't upgrade through Thunderbird help - I had to use download/reinstall. </li></ul> <ul><li> I checked all settings for user name / password; they are fine.  I ""changed"" them to the same thing, just in case a file needed updating. No luck. </li></ul> <ul><li> I have two E-Mail addresses and associated folders on the server;  Thunderbird cannot access either one - same error message.  </li></ul> <ul><li> Messages stay on the server until I move or delete them </li></ul> <ul><li> I can access my E-mail fine through the server E-mail web page; all messages are there.  I made sure user names and passwords were correct. </li></ul> <ul><li> Interestingly (or oddly) I can still Send with Thunderbird.  The message does get sent, then moved to the Sent folder; I cannot see it in Thunderbird, but they are there in server folder (seen on the wep-page version) </li></ul> <p>So the main question is - is Thunderbird suddenly malforming a parameter list (unlikely since the problem is still there after upgrade), or has there been a change on the server such that it no longer likes what Thunderbird is sending for credentials?  The timing is suspicious - first working day of the second half of the year (Wed was a holiday here). </p><p>Any help anyone can provide is much appreciated. </p>",fix-problems;,thunderbird,fix-slowness-crashing-error-messages-and-other-problems,en-US,1329473;1329577;1329590;1329593;1329598;,jrgoddard,false,false,4

Whenever I need to restart my computer, I close my session, restart, reopen Firefox and it loads my entire session no problem. The neat thing about this is that when I do this, the tab title (along with the website icon) is preserved but the actual page only reloads when I switch to that tab. For example, imagine I have a YouTube video titled ""Programming in Python"", the tab would say ""Programming in Python - YouTube"" with the YouTube logo to the left of the title. There is definitely some kind of cache magic going on because say if that video was taken down on YouTube, the title would still be preserved until I switch to that tab. In my latest reloaded session, I noticed that tabs #250-500 failed to load the tab title and instead show the website URL with the icon I attached below. Is there any way to reload these tab titles without actually refreshing the page manually one by one (kinda like how Firefox does it on startup)?

I KNOW that the ISPs manage my connection speeds, router management software WILL be more capable than the Cisco router we managed ourselves!! I notice a similar profile of getting the speeds that are advertised at the start of a contract and then to throttle it as they add more customers to the same kit that they lease from OpenReach; increased latency! I also get OpenReach business notifications and know that the ISPs pay OpenReach for not only bandwidth that they use but also the electricity that powers them, OpenReach also charge for shit loads more but lets stick to the simples! ALL the ISPs deny ANY management function which is disengenuous to say the least!! There is a worrying trend in businesses to not only have no usable phone numbers (I had about eight BT numbers when we had the Cisco Router but NONE work anymore) due to the telephony shit that infests what laughly passes for customer service these days. {Thinks: Is there an undisclosed word limit to this field!?!?? I daren't hit return to go to a new para 'cause it might send like the excreble messaging systems which pass for comms in these benighted days!!

Is it because I have appended ""-old"" to one profile name? </p><p>2) When I click on ""default"", which profile is being loaded and failing?  Is it my qf profile or the ""-old"" profile?  If it is my qf profile, how can I determine what is wrong with that profile? </p><p>3) I also have profiles in Appdata\Local\Thunderbird\Profiles.

If I move it up even more not to the max but just up to say about 1/2"" the drop down window gets bigger however it is still cut down with no way to scroll down to see the rest of the window.

I use Firefox from long long years and I love it so much. The only thing Chrome does better is that while you are using remote debug to debug an app or a mobile website, Chrome shows you a screencast of the connected device and you can interact with the app or the website directly through your mouse: you can select an element hovering and clicking, exactly like you do debugging a desktop website. This is extremely useful and I'd like to get this even in Firefox and I'm wondering why I can't. Can someone explain why and if we can hope this feature will be added in the next future?
