I've looked up a few fixes before posting and they didn't work: </p><p>- Tried booting FF on safe mode and it didn't fix the issue - it clearly isn't caused by an add-on (and I've never had this issue in my previous browser with nearly the same add-ons installed). - other people seem to have had the exact same issue multiple times and it's lasted for years, so it's clearly a problem on FF's end. </p><p>Here is the issue described more specifically: Copying things from a tab from FF and into the online version of Word does not work - when I try to, the intended selection:  - disappears a few seconds after I've pasted - or it does not appear at all - or when it does, it erases the entire sentence it was pasted next to it, which you can imagine is absolutely bothersome. </p><p>I've also tried to copy/paste statistics from a site called <a href=""http://archiveofourown.org"" rel=""nofollow"">archiveofourown.org</a> onto another FF tab. - What ended up being copied is only the last character of the entire content I was trying to paste, which I think suggests there's some issue with what's contained in the clipboard. </p><p>I'm mentioning these two websites because I'm guessing that something about them is probably conflicting with the copy/paste feature, however I'm hoping no one will have the gall to tell me it's those websites' faults and that I should just stop using them. </p><p>When pasting (while having hopefully copied the former selected content- and no, it wasn't the case), it always pastes the content which was last copied into the clipboard prior to that very attempt, which shows that the clipboard's content was not refreshed with the last selected copied one. </p><p>I'm surprised to see that FF has had such a glaring issue for years and for many other users, and updates have never given a fix for it. I'd like this issue to be fixed properly, because I'd hate to have to switch back to my previous browser. FF sports so many nice features that other browsers don't have, and it'd be a shame to ruin the experience with a bug so basic as the copy/paste feature being broken. </p>",firefox-740;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;word;office365;probablynotafirefoxproblem;copyandpaste;copyandpaste74;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1299677;1299705;,yumiifmb

Was like a new account. Maybe even worse, because a new account should have at least one historic page. But this account's historic was  totally erased.

I even have old confirmation emails, proving the account was created on a device, and then logged on a new device, wich required a confirmation password. </p><p>My conclusion : A sync Account was created, cookies were saved into it, then they were deleted and the browser  stopped saving new cookies on the account. I didn't realized because the cookies were alredy stored on my local drive. When i made a new logging, the browser started to save cookies again, and those weren't remains, because they weren't deleted.  </p><p>Could it be that firefox's servers had a malfunction and my data were lost ?

Firefox does not supports this feature.. Why? Question number 2: After setting up master password when I want to save any login info and pass it wants master pass, if I want to view my saved login info it also wants pass.

This is directed to Firefox as an organization. I DEPEND on Firefox. I have 90 - 100 tabs open in multiple accounts, I bought into ""if it doesn't run in the browser"" - I don't want it. Last week, Firefox stopped loading Gmail. Not Gmail Contacts or Calendar - just Gmail. But Gmail worked in if opened in a private window, After much anguish for days, I learned that Right Clicking on a working web page (in the Private Window) allowed me to delete Cache and Cookies FOR JUST GOOGLE. I did it and signed in and whuddaya know, Gmail works again. OK - a blip in the force. Now Slack doesn't work. Exact same symptoms - just non responsive to <a href=""http://slack.com"" rel=""nofollow"">slack.com</a>. Ah Ha I said. Firefox 74 is NFG. Let's just reinstall 73. Ooooh - the miracle minds at Firefox NO LONGER ALLOW DOWNGRADING - BECAUSE (wait for it) - ""most of these problems are not due to an upgrade"". Really? Most? This is not about being polite. This is about allowing a user to revert to a working version when a problem hits. Firefox is losing market share and if you want to know why. Well - here it is. It's unreliable. BTW: I was able to revert Gmail because I had other tabs signed in. I only have 1 Slack tab. I tried using the Private Window tab - nope. I USE Firefox to (1) make my life easier and (2) be more productive than my cohorts. Fail on 1 of those: not good. Fail on both: hello Chrome or any other browser that just works. P.S. I've been using Firefox for...hmmm I'm 70 and its unlikely there was a whole decimal digit in front of my starting version.

While I’m typing, in front of it a grey star appears, such a marking a favorite. However, it’s NOT in my favorites.  The autosuggestions do not come from other opened tabs. This option is turned off.  I don’t use any Firefox subscription account services for storing favorites online.

Or if the main page would appear first (<a href=""http://youtube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">youtube.com</a>) and not any other subpages. Does anyone know if this is possible and then, how to achieve this? </p><p>Lastly: I don’t understand why a browser that claims to be so concerned about my privacy allows for so many unwanted options. Also, it is a nuisance if these options are actually reset with every update Firefox installs. I have the impression that this happens. I did notice that now and then additional search engines are added to my one-click-search engines (about:preferences#search) without my prior notification.

Once again, the developers who believe themselves to be gods do not think users should be allowed to set Firefox to allow Flash on specific sites without asking EVERY SESSION, somehow believing that inconveniencing the users is somehow going to force website admins to move away from Flash before the announced deprecation at the END of the year. </p><p>Now one of my daily-visited sites (the one for Daily Jumble) will not wait for me to enable Flash, and when I do enable it I then have to refresh the page to make it work.  It is obvious that if what I have been asking for all along -- being able to tell Firefox to enable Flash always FOR THIS SITE ONLY -- would alleviate the problem, but since the gods cannot see through the eyes of the users, I am now further inconvenienced by their decision. </p><p>I maintain that they moved too quickly and too drastically to implement this change, and I have no reason to believe posting this will make any difference, but I again want them to know that instead of Firefox being the most user-friendly browser in the world (as it USED to be) it now has enough user-UNfriendliness to be as despised as Internet Explorer was. </p><p>I do not believe it to be an unreasonable request to allow this, because they could simply put that functionality in, then take it out along with all Flash support in the first release of 2021.

I've had a case escalated via Apple support up to their engineering department, and they say the email isn't getting filtered by them but in fact never reaches their servers, so there's nothing they can do. So now I'm stuck on this mailing list because I can't access my account. Blocking me from leaving the list seems illegal per the CAN-SPAM act.

I see the dark humor, but this is a problem that needs to be resolved. I don't know where else to turn for help, so hoping someone here can provide some guidance. The real ask here is not to just get off the mailing list (I could set up a filter to automatically delete it, though I shouldn't have to do that) but instead to be able to receive the email to verify my account or, barring that, get help changing the email address on the existing account to one that can actually receive the email, e.g. my Gmail account. </p>",other;desktop;escalate;,firefox,other,en-US,1297840;1297841;1297851;1297856;1297889;1297898;1297971;,brossow

I tried to open Firefox/Google. To my surprise, all I got was a Blank Window. I tried clicking on the ""Home Icon"". Nothing changed. I tried my Bookmarks. No affect. I WAS Signed In. I tried finding the Fictional ""Firefox Support"". I got nowhere. I would've Googled the issue, but I couldn't even use that. Nothing Worked. I finely decided to download a NEW Firefox/Google. Once I did, it worked fine all day.  The next day, I opened the newly Downloaded one. Again I was greeted by the Firefox ""Update"" It started, then showed an Error.  Again, I tried to open Firefox/Google. I got the same blank page as before. I decided to Remove, ALL Firefox/Google. from my Computer. Then I download another New Firefox. I made ONE change. I stopped Firefox from Updating Automatically.  Day three, I opened Firefox, I opened  normally... Almost. Now I have the SAME Firefox Update waiting. If I let it Download, it may Crash again. I lost ALL of my Bookmarks too. I went to the Recommended Firefox Site to retrieve them... It was a LIE! Now I have the SAME Firefox Update waiting.

It was not the first time I encountered this problem, as it had been happening at irregular intervals, and found that it was caused by firefox replacing the ""cookies.sqlite"" file in my profile folder with a new one, while also dubbing the old one ""cookies.sqlite.bak"". I always resolved the problem by: </p><p>-Closing Firefox </p><p>-Deleting the recently created ""cookies.sqlite"" in my profile folder </p><p>-Renaming ""cookies.sqlite.bak"" into ""cookies.sqlite"" </p><p>-(Usually) Creating a copy of the .bak file and keeping it in a folder as insurance, in case I found no recent .bak the next time it happened or it got corrupted somehow </p><p>After doing this, upon starting firefox I would find all my cookies in place and myself logged in all sites I cared about (I set it up so that firefox restores a long-running, multi-windowed session at startup). </p><p>On a side note, I was always able to know whether my ""cookies.sqlite"" file had been rewritten by checking its size: if it had been just created, it would always be 512 Kb; the backup .bak file is instead 1.50 Mb. </p><p><br> Onto the problem at hand: after updating to 74.0 and finding that I lost all cookies and logins, I repeated the process highlighted above, as usual.  It didn't resolve the problem though: I still didn't recover any cookie even though I switched the ""good"" .bak file with the newly created ""cookies.sqlite"". Upon starting firefox, instead of loading my 1.50 Mb .sqlite it keeps immediately renaming it .bak and creating its own cookies.sqlite.  I even tried using a slightly older .bak, one that I had successfully switched before: the result was the same. </p><p>I am at my wits' end: I checked and tried various cookie and privacy settings, but since firefox updated it seems determined to shun my old cookie backup in favor of creating its own empty, useless file. There also doesn't seem to be any recent documentation on this problem I can find. I even considered opening and checking both .sqlite and .bak files for any obvious differences, but I'm afraid I just don't know how. </p><p><br> Those cookies are critical for my navigation.

That fixed size is far too big for my use case, i.e. I absolutely need it slimmer.
